Real Time Desk Exercises &amp; Stretches - Ask Doctor Jo,CAq9vV7gkrs,Workout,11.12,14159,226,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAq9vV7gkrs,"These desk exercises and stretches are easy to do at your desk. Following along with this 10-minute, real-time routine should help keep your muscles and joints moving throughout the day. See Doctor Jo’s blog post about this at: http://www.askdoctorjo.com/desk-exercises-stretches-real-time

To start off, work your whole body and large muscles by doing a simple sit to stand movement. Put your feet about shoulder width apart, and stand up and sit down five times. Now while sitting, do a rotation stretch of the upper body to loosen up your spine. Turn one direction in your chair, and grab the back if you want a little more of a stretch. Hold these for about five seconds on each side. Do three on each side.

Next, you will stretch your forearm muscles. If you are typing a lot through out the day, these will hopefully feel really good. Start off with your arm straight out in front of you. Bring your wrists downward or into flexion. If you need more of a stretch, push down with the other hand. Hold for about five seconds and alternate sides. Now bring your wrists upward to stretch the opposite side.

The next exercises will be seated hip flexion. If you can roll your chair out from under your desk so you don’t hit your knees on the desk. Bring your knee upwards, and slowly come back down. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. Then you will kick your leg out to work your quad muscles. Kick your leg out until your knee is straight, and then pull your toes up towards you for a stretch. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. 

Now you will stretch your buttocks muscles that you are sitting on all day long. Take the leg of the side you want to stretch, and cross it over the other leg just above the knee. This will look like a figure 4 if you are looking down at your legs. You might feel the stretch already, but if you don’t, keeping your back straight, bend forward at your hips. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, and repeat 3 times.

Finally, stretch and exercise your calf muscles to help prevent DVTs. With your feet on the ground, alternate lifting your toes, and then lift your heels. Do ten of these.

Standing Desk Workout - 5 Exercises to do at Work,9N6ZQz-CV44,Workout,5.23,22451,310,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N6ZQz-CV44,"5 Exercises to do at a Stand-Up Desk, benefits of standing up more plus stand-up desk converter recommendations. 
Benefits = More energy, Better productivity, Less body stiffness, Stronger core and glutes, Flexible spine (less back pain).

If you're at work and you start to feel your energy drop and you're thinking about that third cup of coffee or a sugary snack to keep you going,  you might want to get your body moving instead. Not only does standing up for some of your day give you a more sustainable energy boost than an energy drink, but it also helps your body feel less tight and stiff. If you find yourself sitting down most of your day at work, you might want to get yourself a stand-up desk option or get up and do these moves every hour or half hour. 

If you are standing up at work already then here are 5 moves for you to strengthen your core and glutes, help your posture, loosen up a stiff neck and spine, plus get more focussed and productive while you work.

INTENSE Exercises To Do At Your Desk,DgxuAKSa6OM,Workout,10.52,155017,3356,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgxuAKSa6OM,"Hello Fitness Family! 

Back again with a workout video for you but this time, as you can see, I come to work with you! Really wanted to give those of you who have such busy schedules some options, so I conjured up some exercises into a nice little grouping you can do right at work, at your desk! I warn you (both men and women) that some of these exercises can generate some sweat so make sure you have your anti-perspirant handy and a clean undershirt (guys) and for women a shirt to change into, just incase! Please make sure you keep your BACK STRAIGHT, CORE TIGHT, CONCENTRATING and BREATHING NICE AND STEADY throughout the exercise grouping! 

""THE CUBICLE WORKOUT"" 
-- 5 EXERCISES GROUPED TOGETHER TO STIMULATE YOUR UPPER BODIES MOST IMPORTANT MUSCLES-- 
BEGINNERS: 5-10 SEC HOLDS, 2-3 SETS EACH 
ADVANCED: 15-20 SEC HOLDS, 4-5 SETS EACH

1ST EXERCISE -- PUSHES -- Sitting down, keep back straight, elbows out, hands open with palms out as if you are about to clap. Then put your hands flat together and push against each hand AS HARD AS YOU CAN -- This works your CHEST, BICEPS, TRICEPS, CORE, LATS -- Repeat according to your fitness level.

2ND EXERCISE -- PULLS -- Sitting down, keep back straight, elbows out, hands (fingers) interlocked with each other with palms out, then pull each hand AS HARD AS YOU CAN -- This works your LATS, BICEPS, FOREARMS, UPPER BACK, TRICEPS, CORE -- Repeat according to your fitness level.

3RD EXERCISE -- PUSHES W/ TOP/BOTTOM OF FISTS -- Sitting down, keep back straight, elbows out, make a fist with your hand like you are going to give yourself a pound, then push up with your bottom fist and push down with your top fist at the same time AS HARD AS YOU CAN -- This works your TRICEPS, BICEPS, FOREARMS, UPPER BACK, CHEST, CORE -- Repeat according to your fitness level.

4TH -- EXTENDED ARM PRESSES (LOW & HIGH) -- Sitting down, keeping your back straight, extend your arms out, open your palms and put your hands together like you are going to dive into a pool, but point your arms downward rather than straight out. Press your hands together while keeping your arms straight AS HARD AS YOU CAN (Do the exact same thing for the high presses) -- This works your CHEST, BICEPS, TRICEPS, SHOULDERS, LATS, UPPER BACK, FOREARMS, CORE -- Repeat according to your fitness level.

5TH EXERCISE -- UPRIGHT AIR CLAPS  -- Sitting down, keep back straight, arms in a 90 degree angle parallel to your body, then while keeping the best form you can, pretend like you want to clap as ahrd as you can without hitting your hands for 30 SECONDS AS FAST (and steady) AS YOU CAN -- This works your SHOULDERS, CORE, ARMS, BASICALLY YOUR WHOLE UPPER BODY -- THIS EXERCISE IS 30 SECONDS FOR BEGINNERS. IF YOU ARE ADVANCED DO 1 MINUTE.

Hope you guys who work those office jobs enjoy this! Had a great time making the video and big thank you to my missing puzzle piece Carli for being an amazing inspiration to me...I LOVE YOU.

10 Min Office Workout Exercises - Quick Office Workout Routine - 1 workout a day,M_heu5pg2IQ,Workout,10.47,99279,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_heu5pg2IQ,"This is a training video:

10 Min Office Workout Exercises - Quick Office Workout Routine - How to Workout in Your Office

How to use my workout channel the most efficient way:

Pick what type of look you want to achieve with your training and how you like to train.

You have the following options:

1. I want to lose weight or I have never trained before. I am of a bigger size or I am of small/normal size, but I am too weak or don't have the skills to do workouts. IF THIS IS YOU... then you should do my 4 month weight loss program. This plan teaches you slowly to move your body everyday. Progressing each week so that you can end up with more energy and strength to be able to perform my harder programs. And to get the best results, please do the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 4 month weight loss program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbf0Vo4UlTo&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5ymDN3SdKOvNuJj9xw-n5YE 

2. I want a slim toned type of body and I like doing light toning exercises. I really don't want to build any muscle on my body, but I still want a feminine curvy shape. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT... then you should do my 3 month model program. This plan is based on toning up your whole body and fat burn without building visible muscle. And to get the best results, please follow the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 3 month model program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvJvaYKYvvs&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5x_834mP_tCWxA_DDfyO5fN

3. I want a curvy athletic shape with steel abs and a hard ass lol! If you want more visible muscle and possibly a Sixpack, then this is the plan for you. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.... then you should do my 3 month power program. You will build your glutes, six pack and strong arms. To get the the best results, please follow the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 3 month power program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CatXFOgOjDI&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5xQW-6WSemh-5wCc9JqvbKQ

4. I want to get in shape for bikini season and FAST! I want a firmer bum, a flatter stomach and flashy toned arms. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.... then you should do my 8 weeks bikini body guide. To get the the best results, please follow the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 8 week bikini guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WOV7x4eOCQ&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5y135e-4MpXVKdIjZOzM_Jc

5. I just want to start training, get in better shape, but I'm too busy! IF THIS IS YOU... then you should do my 30 days challenge. It's a great way to get in shape without putting too much time on it. You'll train 10-30minutes maximum per day. To get the the best results, please follow my model meal guide together with this plan.

Here is the 30 days challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VEW3cA0054&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5yqAa9BTKSDJaWy8Ch8JXxA

As for the meal guides. They are all based around 1500-1600 calories. The only difference is the way of eating, measuring food and how many times a day you'll eat. I recommend you to go through each meal guide and pick one that would suit your type of eating pattern and lifestyle best. You can use one meal guide from another program if that suits your life better.","['1 workout a day', 'fitness blender', 'blogilates', 'fitness', 'office workout exercises', 'office workout for women', 'office workout routine', 'office workout for men', 'office workout videos', 'office workout abs', 'office workout to loose weight', '10 min office workout', '10 minute office workout']"

Douglas Chang, MD, PhD, chief of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Services at UC San Diego Health (https://health.ucsd.edu/ortho), recommends you take a break from the keyboard once or twice an hour and shows some simple stretches you can do at home or at the office to relieve and prevent those knots and kinks.","['Relief from back pain', 'back stretches', 'back stretches for computer users', 'UC San Diego Health', 'Douglas Chang MD', 'Relief from neck pain', 'exercises for neck pain', 'exercises for back pain', 'orthopedic surgeon San Diego', 'Stretching at work', 'daily stretches']"
2 Minutes office chair workout | Stress Relieving Exercise,GWTpAJW0q9M,Workout,4.12,15704,118,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWTpAJW0q9M,"There’s simply no way around it: You must sit at your desk to get work done. So, what do you do when all that chair time causes pain to erupt in your shoulders, wrists, or lower back? The office can be really stressful. Watch this video to learn quick office relaxation techniques by Hiral Vyas, our Yoga expert. When we get stressed, we tend to hold our breath in, Hiral says. 

Simple deep breathing helps any stale air out (as well as any tension that we may be holding on to) and encourages deep, energizing inhales to flow in effortlessly: Sit with both feet flat on the floor, and on the edge of your chair seat so your body is not pressed against the chair back. Inhale to a count of three then exhale to a count of six. Repeat five to 10 times. And you will feel fresh instantly. Try consciously slowing your breathing and focus on taking regular deep breaths. 

You can also try placing one hand just below your breastbone and one on your stomach. This will help you to notice that your abdomen (tummy) rises as you breathe in and goes down when you breathe out. Breathing out is particularly associated with relaxation, so specifically, try to slow down the rate of your out breath. It may feel odd or unnatural to start with, but slowing down your breathing can really help you to relax. When you start to feel tense or stressed, take a small walk. Taking your mind off things for a while definitely helps.

Mini-Desk Workout: Fixing a Slouched Posture,-cw0X0NAwUw,Workout,3.28,610,10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cw0X0NAwUw,"www.coreadvantage.com.au

Who else had parents that told them to stand or sit up straight at least three times a day? Not any teenagers favourite thing to hear, but sadly like parents often are, they were right, given how much we sit these days, sitting with a better posture, or doing some work to loosen up the tightness we accumulate is vital.

The spine has four segments, the cervical (neck), thoracic (ribcage), lumbar (lower back), and sacral (tailbone). Each segment has either a kyphotic (forwards) or Lordotic (backwards curve).
Neutral spine
When we sit at a desk, the forward curve of the thoracic becomes exaggerated into a hunchback type position, over time the joints of the thoracic spine become stiff and locked like the links of a rusty bike chain.

If the thoracic loses its range of motion (it tends to tighten worst in extension and rotation), the lumbar spine has to pick up the slack and becomes the primary point of motion. This overload on the lower back can lead to stress fractures, muscular overload or disc injury. 

So often lower back tightness or injury is a symptom. The true cause of lower back pain often stems from a tight thoracic or tight/weak hips
What we need to do is loosen those joints to re-establish mobility and range into both extension and rotation.
Thoracic spine
Step one is to mechanically loosen out the joints.

Grab a roller. Under the middle of your back. Hoodies and ponytails out of the way, hands behind your head and open up the chest, relaxing your head down the ground. Once you are fully opened up, little rolls up and back under the ribs.

You might get some pops and cracks, this is a good thing. That's those joints loosening back up. If the roller's too easy, the next option is to use backballs. Put these along your spine starting at the top and slowly work your way down the spine until about the middle. 

Pro Tip: Rolling over a basketball, soccer ball, or netball is another great way of loosening up the 

Once you've mechanically loosened up the joints with the roller or backballs, gentle mobilising drills are next.

The cat-camel (sometimes called happy cat-angry cat), helps loosen up and reintroduce range of motion into the spine through extension. Really important though; if this causes any sharp pain, stop immediately. It should not hurt your lower back but instead just a stretching sensation along the entire spine.

It's all well and good loosening things off. But if you don't put this new mobility into practice, the gains you make just evaporate.

Start at the head, tucking the chin in and imagine there is a string pulling your head to the ceiling. Shrug the shoulders up then bring them back and down. This taller, longer posture will help reduce the effects of the desk and stop that newly mobilised spine from tightening back up, plus as a bonus, it makes you a little bit taller.

FAST Desk Workout -  At Work Exercises that WORK!,H6SJ1TALyP8,Workout,4.45,9357,135,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6SJ1TALyP8,"Have more energy for your workouts - http://athleanx.com/x/workoutenergy

Did you know that sitting at your desk for more than 6 hours a day not only limits your energy to workout after work but also shaves years off your life?  Not anymore, because we are going to keep you moving with exercises you can do at work to get you energized and ready to workout after work.

In fact, these 4 exercises can all be done discreetly while sitting at your desk!

The important thing to consider when you have a desk job that limits your activity is that doing even just a little bit (more often) helps to keep your muscles on alert and prevents them from wasting away over time.  In this quick desk workout video, we give you a simple plan for getting in more exercise at work (even if you're chained to your desk from the time you walk in).

You'll want to address your posture by performing the shoulder roll back exercise seen first.  Then you'll move onto training your abs while sitting in your chair with the seated knee tucks exercise.  Then you'll want to work the shoulders, triceps and legs together with one great chair exercise that you can do right at your desk.  Finally, you'll want to really work those triceps and abs again...this time with a more advanced exercise called the L Sit.

Doing these even just a couple times in the day can help to not only energize you at work but make you more likely to not skip your workout after work.  A body in motion tends to stay in motion.  A body at rest stays at rest.  Get yourself moving with these 4 at work desk exercises and see just how much better you'll feel after.

When the time comes when your work day is over, you'll want to be sure you have a workout program that you can follow that won't take up the rest of your day!  In fact, with many women having busy family lives they have to tend to after work, we don't think asking you to workout for 1 hour or more is right (or even necessary).  That is why we put together the Athlean-XX for Women workout program.  In just 33 minutes a day or less you can get a toned, lean, sculpted, seXXy body.  Visit http://athleanxxforwomen.com for more information.

As for the meal guides. They are all based around 1500-1600 calories. The only difference is the way of eating, measuring food and how many times a day you'll eat.

Desk Exercises at Work | Office Workout: Exercises at Desk While Working,EI7rPiEGVS8,Workout,2.5,734,12,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI7rPiEGVS8,"Sitting for a prolonged duration at work reduces blood circulation to muscles and joints. This results in poor posture, which may cause back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, wrist strain, or a potbelly. 

Improving posture at work ensures that you obtain optimal blood circulation. This alleviates muscle stiffness and pan. Posture correction exercise that help with neck and shoulder pain are neck stretches, lateral neck flexion stretches, cross-body arm stretches, etc.

Also find the best laptop position at work for yourself to prevent spinal issues. Doctors recommend aligning the screen to an optimal height that you can view without bending your back/neck, keeping your elbows at 90-degrees, and allowing your feet to rest on the ground. These practices promote perfect posture that aid spine health. Using a posture corrector can also help you with your initial efforts to improve spine health. 

Even if you follow posture correction tips, it is best to get up from your workstation and walk around once every hour or two. If you suffer from foot, knee, or hip pain, you can try head raises, toe walking, and ankles circles. They aid in maintaining proper posture and reducing pain.

Please remember that we cannot spot reduce fat, meaning we can’t choose the areas on our body where we loose fat. However to get fat loss results I recommend the following
1. Being in calorie deficit
2. Cardio/ HIIT workout (I often call these Fat Loss/Burn workouts on my channel)
3. Specific muscle targeted workouts. To strengthen and develop specific muscles.
The key to achieving your fitness and health goals is consistency and healthy lifestyle changes, without restriction. I don’t believe in crazy fad diets. Simply eat nutritious food, move your body, smile and enjoy the journey!

Here’s what the cardio workout includes:

7 exercises for 30 seconds each with 15 seconds of active recovery jogging between each exercise.  Since each exercise is only done for 30 seconds, be sure to challenge yourself to maximize your results in the short amount of time this workout takes.

Jumping Jacks – 30 seconds

5-Minute Warm Up for At-Home Workouts,Ks-lKvKQ8f4,Workout,5.92,5731336,60167,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-lKvKQ8f4,"Get access to more workouts by becoming a Patreon member: https://www.patreon.com/nicolepearce

Before any workout—and especially a high intensity one!—it's important to prepare your body. Depending on the type of workout you're about to do and any muscle imbalances or recovering injuries you have, a proper warm up will vary. In general though, you want to include some light-to-moderate cardio to gradually increase the heart rate and some dynamic (active) stretches for joint mobility.

This 5-minute warm up is made with the at-home workouts I post to my blog in mind. We'll start with two minutes of cardio bodyweight exercises and then move onto active stretches for a functional range of motion.

For more information on warm ups and workout ideas to do afterwards, check out my blog: http://pumpsandiron.com/2016/09/27/5-min-warm-up-for-at-home-workouts/

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GENTLER WARM UP, I have a toned down version of this video. No jumping during the cardio and a slower allover pace: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNJfhtfTJKY&feature=youtu.be

To be honest: I don't stretch enough. At the moment I just have 1 or 2 (that's optimistic) relaxed stretching sessions per week. 
With this cool down routine, I might change my habits though :D We all have 5min after a workout. And 5min (= 10 exercises) already go a long way. 
We stretch the sides of our body, our legs, tummy and work on our spine and hip mobility. No new or fancy exercises - but finally a super quick video we can stick to :D 

Let's calm down & give our bodies some love in a different kind of way.

5-Minute Workout to Get a Flat Stomach In a Week,kXFSy-DZasQ,Workout,10.83,2827953,54585,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXFSy-DZasQ,"How to get a flat stomach?

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY: 
- #1. Unlike other ab exercises, this one doesn't isolate abdominal muscles. Instead, standing knee raises train your upper and lower abs along with your hip, shoulder, and back muscles. Plus, this exercise doesn't strain your neck and lower back.
- #2. Floating knee tucks work your upper and lower abs to define and sculpt them. This exercise also makes your whole core stronger. It develops overall mobility and muscle endurance.
- #3. Roll-up lifts are perfect for your abdominal muscles. Besides, they help make your core stronger and increase your flexibility.
- #4. Not only does this exercise sculpt your abs, you’ll also see a more defined tush!
- #5. This exercise works your upper and lower abdominal muscles as well as your obliques. And that’s a great muscle group to target if you’re dealing with that all-so annoying muffin top. Bicycle crunches also train your quads, hamstrings, hips, and chest muscles.
- #6. Flutter kicks work magic on your lower abs and obliques. You also train your hip flexors and thigh muscles. Just be careful, and don’t do the fluttering motion too fast.
- #7. Oblique twist crunches are perfect for strengthening and defining the abs and waist. The exercise involves both the internal and external obliques, which means that not only your abs but also your core becomes stronger. As a result, it can help protect your spine and back muscles from injuries.
- #8. Twisting side plank is an effective way to tone your waist. And that’s because it targets the abs and obliques. It also strengthens the muscles of your core overall.

If you're in need of a five-minute full body stretch, then this video is for you!  This routine has 14 stretches, held for 20 second each, that will loosen your major muscle groups from head to toe.

One of the secrets of success with flexibility is having a routine. It doesn’t need to be long or complicated, either. Doing just a few minutes of basic stretches on most days of the week will help prevent the loss of flexibility while keeping your body performing optimally. 

A few quick pointers:
1. Studies show that a great time to stretch is after a cardio workout, when your muscles are warm from the increased blood flow.
2. You should feel a gentle stretch, not pain.
3. Remember to breathe throughout the stretch

5 MIN LOWER BODY WORKOUT (NO REST TABATA) // No Equipment &amp; Fat Burning | 5분 하체지방 폭파 타바타 운동,JIQUbPqfVV4,Workout,5.37,798820,16156,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIQUbPqfVV4,"Happy New Year. This is Louis from Allblanc TV.
Today's workout is 5 minute lower body tabata without ""rest"" !!
It is basically home-training routine (no equipment needed) so you can do everywhere, at home or gym.
Since it is more intense than normal one, you would feel stronger after finishing it.

What is your goal of 2020? What do you want to achieve this year?
For me, I decide to make stronger and healthier body in my life and give more motivation to you guys.
Therefore, I am preparing videos about more details of the workout routines. I hope all of you get motivated and follow and use them :)

Our 2020 just started !! Let's go to workout with me.
Thank you all

안녕하세요, 여러분. 올블랑 루이스입니다.  
오늘의 운동은 ""휴식없는"" 5분 하체운동 타바타입니다.
기본적으로 덤벨이나 도구가 필요없어 어디서든 운동하실 수 있게 홈트레이닝 루틴으로 만들었습니다! 
저희의 다른 타바타 운동보다 휴식시간이 없어 좀 더 강도가 높을테지만 그만큼 더 강해진다는 느낌을 받으실 꺼예요:)

여러분들의 2020년 목표는 무엇인가요? 올해는 무엇을 꼭 성취하고 싶으신가요?
저는 올해 제 인생에서 더 건강하고 강한 몸을 만들어보려고 합니다. 또한 여러분들에게도 많은 동기부여를 드리고 싶어요.
그래서 제 운동 루틴을 좀 더 상세하게 소개하는 영상들을 준비하고 있습니다. 앞으로 올라올 영상들을 통해서 여러분들이 더 많이 동기부여 받으시고 쉽게 활용하시기를 바랄께요^^

그럼, 희망차게 운동하러 가볼까요!?

Official Anabolic Aliens video of: Intense 5 Minute At Home Bicep Workout #2.

Give this intense 5 minute at home bicep workout a try! You get a full biceps workout without having to leave your house. Also, this works as a killer circuit to do at the gym more toward the end of your weighted bicep workout since it's bodyweight only. Routines like this are great for those who travel and want to get a workout in too! No weights are needed. Your biceps will be feeling it the next day due to how effective this circuit is! 5 exercises, the first 4 are 30 seconds long each arm, then the last exercise uses both arms together for a full minute. Follow along with the video if you'd like, a timer is run throughout on the screen!

10 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT // No Equipment | Pamela Reif,6VFLKdfxA24,Workout,10.53,4947497,65860,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VFLKdfxA24,"Let's kickstart this year together / Werbung!! 
I trained more than 3x a week for 97% of 2019! That means I managed to workout regularly during 49 out of the 52 weeks that 2019 had to offer. 
That was only possible with my ""No Equipment"" workouts - otherwise I wouldn't have managed to be so consistent while traveling. When I'm home, I enjoy going to the gym & do some weight lifting as well :) but whenever I don't have time for that, I literally do sports with myself on YouTube.  I usually combine several videos, to have a 45-60min workout. 

__

This is a 10 minute Full Body Workout. I really ENJOY doing this one. I sometimes lose my balance when doing the ""Sprinters"" in the beginning - but that gets better over time! 

No Equipment necessary, no breaks (you're used to it by now I guess) and not much space needed :) If you need a break - take it! But make sure to join me again ♥︎

The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing. 30s for each exercise. 

I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your muscles in another way: check out my 10min Ab Workout, 20min Booty Workout or the Cooldown Routine to end your workout!

A 10min routine was definitely missing on my channel! Still a killer, still burning lots of calories, still breaking a sweat.. but: it's only 10 minutes :D 

This workout is:
1. FILLED WITH BASICS. 
Nothing too fancy, nothing too dancy. Ask your male partner to join! They won't need to shake their hips for this one.
2. a mix out of ""QUICK MOVEMENTS"" and ""ACTIVE BREAKS"".  
You will find Dolphin Holds & Planks in between all the quick movements. Almost feels like a break, but don't forget to keep the core strength :D
3. HIGH ENERGY. 
For some reason it doesn't drag me down - but rather gives me MORE energy! Might also be the music though.

by the way: NO LUNGES. 

__

If you struggle or need a break: don't worry about it. Take a small rest, get something to drink & continue once you're ready :) most important is that you don't quit and push yourself. 

▸ Depending on your fitness level, height and weight you will burn between 70-130 kcal. 
I burned about 80kcal in those 10min (which is a lot for me, I'm a small human and I normally burn about 250kcal in a 1h session).

Let's start with saying: I love this workout so much. It's not too intense, still gives you a good burn & stretches your body with loooong movements. 
Perfect for mornings, to kickstart your day and get a nice feeling overall ♥︎ 

No Equipment necessary, no breaks (you're used to it by now I guess) and not much space needed :) If you need a break tho - take it! Just don't quit! 

The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. 

I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your muscles in another way: check out my Sixpack Video, 20min Booty Workout, Sexy Arm Trainings or the Calorie Burn Session!

Whenever I meet people who workout with my videos & ask them which one they like most they ALWAYS say: ""your Sixpack Workout!"". 
After 1.5 years it might be time for a new one then haha! 

MY OPINION: burns even more, makes me sweat more and gives me such a good feeling in my abs! Maybe it's also because I'm not as ""used"" to this exercise combination yet. In any way: you should definitely give it a try :) 

▸ Would love to hear which one you prefer - the old or the new one?

10 MIN BEGINNER AB WORKOUT // No Equipment | Pamela Reif,1f8yoFFdkcY,Workout,10.5,23724135,320865,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f8yoFFdkcY,"Ohhhh yes - a BEGINNER ab workout! ♥︎ / Werbung 

If you have a hard time keeping up with my super intense ""10min Ab Workout"" and ""10min Sixpack Workout""... THIS ONE IS FOR YOU :) 

Everybody starts somewhere and my other workouts require suuuper strong core muscles. That's why I really wanted to create an ab workout, that is suitable for beginners - while still being super effective. 

And listen.. it even includes BREAKS! :D 
(If you feel like it's too easy with the breaks though: just continue the last exercise during the break & jump into the new movement one once I start with it as well)

My mom tried this workout and said, that it's 100% manageable for her .. although she usually isn't so much into working out. That means: no excuses for you. GIVE IT A TRY ♥︎

__

No Equipment necessary and not much space needed :) The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. There is a small break included and you can have a look at what exercise is up next. 

I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles.
I have more workouts that are suitable for beginners! Check out my 
- 20min Full Body Workout,
- Good Morning Workout, 
- 10min Cool Down Routine or my 
- 10min Sexy Arm Workout

SUMMARY
-Take the plank position, but make sure you are standing on your elbows. You can start from 10 seconds and gradually increase it all the way up to 30 seconds.
-Take the elbow plank position again, but this time with your palms on the floor. For the first 10 seconds lift your left leg as we are showing.
-Now you need only one elbow. Hold yourself on it, while the other hand is at your waist. Your legs should be on top of each other.
-Go from the elbow plank position to the regular plank position and back. You should do this one arm at a time.
-When squatting, make sure your feet don’t move, and your hands are straight! We recommend doing at least 20 squats, but it depends on you.
-Now you need to do 15 lunges. They should be pretty low, with your knee almost touching the floor.
-Lie on the floor with your knees up. Your arms should be on floor — you will use them to keep the balance. Lift your butt 20 times.
-Take weights and stretch your arms like you see in the video. Now make circles with your arms. We recommend 40 reps.
-The punches don’t have to be very fast and strong. Be as relaxed as you can. Do it 40 times.
-You should do 20 push-ups on your knees with your feet crossed. Keep your back straight while doing the exercise.
-Lift your right knee up and put it down. Right after that, put both your hands up and put them down.
-Take the full plank position again. Bend your right knee 20 times and then repeat it with your right knee.
-Take the full plank position again. Then you need to switch to the I-am-about-to-jump-up position with your hands touching the ground, then, jump up.

10 MIN CALORIE KILLER / Medium Level - a HIIT workout that won&#39;t kill you I Pamela Reif,NmCXy7oMsOs,Workout,10.53,2835428,47438,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCXy7oMsOs,"This workout kills calories, but it won't kill YOU! ♥︎ / Anzeige

Yes, that's right. I created a routine that won't make you gasping for air, calling me bad names & question your life haha. 
This routine includes pretty basic movements and always switches between ""getting your heart rate up"" and static holds as an ""active rest"". 

I hope you enjoy this one (and the view in Ibiza)!! ♥︎

▸ calories burned are between 70-110kcal, depending on your weight, height & fitness level!  I'm a short and tiny person & I burned 70kcal :) 

__

The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. If you need a break - TAKE IT! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! I also recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. 

▸ you can find WORKOUT PLANS with those videos on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations. Check out the Highlight Bubble ""Workout Plans"" for that.

10 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT (NO EQUIPMENT BODYWEIGHT WORKOUT!),rAU7taj1g6E,Workout,10.48,248091,6490,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAU7taj1g6E,"If you wish to grow you Abs and develop a nice looking mid section, you MUST train them directly. I can not stress this enough: no matter how much you can dead lift, squat or bench press, your abs will simply never pop if you can't perform a strict, controlled leg raise. So, if you're after a nice set of abs, please understand that training them directly is an absolute essential piece to the puzzle. However, when it's all said and done, if you're not incorporating the necessary nutritional protocols, then they will simply never shine through.

Control is also crucial when training your Abs. Understand that if you can't see you Abs, it's either cause your body fat is too high or your Abs simply aren't developed enough for them to shine through. And sure you could pin this to 'genetics', but that would most be a bunch of BS. The truth is that abs are very easy to neglect... even though it's one of the most desired and aesthetically pleasing muscle groups. There’s simply no way around it - and if you’re wanting to develop solid six pack, you’ll want to make sure you’re building in the gym & revealing them in kitchen.

This video is full length which means you can just follow along with whatever I'm doing. If you need extra rest, just pause the video. If you don't need a rest - watch it the whole way through.

You can hit this home workout 2-3x per week - and if you wanted to keep active on your other days - be sure to check out my other workouts!

Real Time Desk Exercises &amp; Stretches - Ask Doctor Jo,CAq9vV7gkrs,Stretch,11.12,14159,226,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAq9vV7gkrs,"These desk exercises and stretches are easy to do at your desk. Following along with this 10-minute, real-time routine should help keep your muscles and joints moving throughout the day. See Doctor Jo’s blog post about this at: http://www.askdoctorjo.com/desk-exercises-stretches-real-time

To start off, work your whole body and large muscles by doing a simple sit to stand movement. Put your feet about shoulder width apart, and stand up and sit down five times. Now while sitting, do a rotation stretch of the upper body to loosen up your spine. Turn one direction in your chair, and grab the back if you want a little more of a stretch. Hold these for about five seconds on each side. Do three on each side.

Next, you will stretch your forearm muscles. If you are typing a lot through out the day, these will hopefully feel really good. Start off with your arm straight out in front of you. Bring your wrists downward or into flexion. If you need more of a stretch, push down with the other hand. Hold for about five seconds and alternate sides. Now bring your wrists upward to stretch the opposite side.

The next exercises will be seated hip flexion. If you can roll your chair out from under your desk so you don’t hit your knees on the desk. Bring your knee upwards, and slowly come back down. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. Then you will kick your leg out to work your quad muscles. Kick your leg out until your knee is straight, and then pull your toes up towards you for a stretch. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. 

Now you will stretch your buttocks muscles that you are sitting on all day long. Take the leg of the side you want to stretch, and cross it over the other leg just above the knee. This will look like a figure 4 if you are looking down at your legs. You might feel the stretch already, but if you don’t, keeping your back straight, bend forward at your hips. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, and repeat 3 times.

Finally, stretch and exercise your calf muscles to help prevent DVTs. With your feet on the ground, alternate lifting your toes, and then lift your heels. Do ten of these.

Desk stretches to reduce pain and discomfort,h40hScXJo20,Stretch,1.68,1322,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40hScXJo20,"Why should you consider desk stretches? Making time for short breaks in your daily routine can reduce risk of injury. These “micro-breaks” should be taken before you start to feel pain, discomfort, or tiredness. That's why it's important to plan for them when you schedule your time.

Desk stretches don't take much time. Other productive micro-breaks could be a quick walk up and down the stairs, or a walking meeting. These activities give your eyes and muscles a chance to recover if you spend a lot of your time at a computer. They improve blood flow, relieve tension, and reduce the risk of eye strain.

These neck and shoulder stretches form an ideal stretching routine for a quick work or study break at your desk. Hope you enjoy!

Neck Exercises Demonstrated in Video
1. Shoulder Rolls - to release tension in upper shoulder and neck muscles coordinated with breathing to release muscle tension
2. Ear to shoulder stretch - feel the stretch in the side of the neck and shoulder. This stretches the side of neck and upper shoulder away from the direction of head movement.
3. Nose towards thigh stretch - stretches the side and back of neck into the shoulder blade on the side of the neck away from the direction of head movement. This action stretches the upper trapezius and levator scapula muscles as well as opening the facet joints in the neck.
4. Head forward tilt stretch - taking nose forwards stretches back of neck and upper back muscles.
5. Neck rotation stretch - turning head and looking over shoulder stretches upper shoulder and side of neck muscles. The addition of over pressure can help increase neck rotation movement.
6. Arc of movement taking chin to chest from one shoulder to the other - stretches the neck and upper shoulder muscles and opens facet joints in the neck.

Always avoid overstretching and keep your breathing relaxed when stretching for maximum benefit. All neck pain stretches should feel comfortable during and after stretching. Cease any exercise that causes discomfort during or after stretching.","['neck pain', 'physical therapy', 'neck stretches', 'shoulder stretches', 'neck exercises', 'Michelle Kenway', 'Physiotherapy', 'neck pain relief']"

Hi! I'm Christina, and welcome to my yoga YouTube channel, ChriskaYoga! This is a 10 minute yoga sequence that you can do during work right in your office chair. You can actually do this in any kind of chair, and it's a great way to destress and unwind during your work day. 

We'll begin the sequence by sitting up tall in your chair with your back up straight and feet planted on the ground. After a brief guided meditation, we'll come into some neck and shoulder stretches to release tension. 

We will then take a forward fold in our chair to release out your low back. To stretch out your whole body, we're going to stand up from the chair (if you would like to) and reach all the way up looking towards your hands (utthita hastasana in tadasana), and we'll also take a slight arch looking up and opening our chest. 

Once done, we'll sit back down and stretch our arms, and then we will come into a modified seated pigeon pose alternative stretching the glutes, thighs, and hips. After this, we will take a seated twist and side bend on both sides, and then take another short meditation sitting up tall in the chair.

WHY DO I GET NECK AND BACK PAIN AT WORK?

Think about it - when you get to work in the morning you probably sit down in your chair and then don’t get up until lunchtime. Then you sit back down and don’t stand up again until it’s time to go home.

As humans, we simply weren’t designed to sit for that amount of time! Add the fact that most of us don’t sit in a workstation that fits us the right way and it’s no wonder we experience neck and back pain at work.

FIRST STEP - SET UP YOUR WORKSPACE

The first (and most important) thing you need to do is set up your workstation in a way that is right for your body. This is the fastest way to decrease stress on your muscles and joints and help you out of the pain you might be experiencing. To learn how to do this, please watch this helpful video: https://youtu.be/x12GnuV9Qgw

Back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal conditions among office workers. You might be fortunate enough to use a sit to stand desk, but working for several hours can still cause problems. 

Whether you’re sitting or standing, the muscles in your back and legs can become tight causing increased strain in your joints. Using a standing mat and taking breaks will help, but stretching is a more direct way to address these symptoms. Stretching exercises can improve your back pain and increase your flexibility. 

In this video, Taylor shows you twelve excellent stretches that you can do in standing, sitting, or on the floor.

10 Minute Standing Stretches | Pilates at Your Desk,iz-IXKMF0G4,Stretch,10.18,6113,96,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz-IXKMF0G4,"If you sit at a desk all day, you body will thank you for taking 10 minutes to do some standing stretches and there is no better break than doing Pilates at Your Desk.

We are going to get up out of the chair and take a few minutes to move and stretch. 

I can almost guarantee that you will feel better after these standing Pilates inspired stretches and this video proves that we don’t need a long mat Pilates session to feel so much better. 

This is a Pilates class for the days when you don’t have much time and bonus, it can be done in your regular clothes. I do recommend a stable chair or surface for support.  

Even if you are beginning Pilates, these 10 minute Pilates stretches are easy to follow along.

You can do this Pilates class at home with no equipment or in the office.

Neck Pain Stretches &amp; Exercises - Ask Doctor Jo,2NOsE-VPpkE,Stretch,4.93,3428207,36018,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NOsE-VPpkE,"Neck Pain Stretches & Exercises: http://www.AskDoctorJo.com Doctor Jo shows you some simple stretches for neck pain. Remember to be very careful with neck stretching exercises, and make sure you have a proper diagnosis from your doctor. Rotation, side bending, flexion, and extension stretching will help loosen your neck muscles. Also stretching your levator scapulae and trapezius muscles will help with some tension headaches.

More Details About This Video:
If you are having some neck pain, stiffness, or tightness, check out this video for neck stretches. The neck muscles that are affected the most are your trapezius and levator scapulae muscles. People often describe neck pain as a crick in their neck. First start off with some gentle neck stretches by bringing your chin to your chest and then looking up towards the ceiling. This is neck flexion and extension. Next you are going to take your ear to your shoulder on each side. Make sure you are not shrugging your shoulders up. This is side bending. Then you are going to turn your head from side to side like you are looking over your shoulder. This is neck rotation. If that is not painful, then you can add some overpressure with your hands. 

Now place your hand under your thigh to keep your shoulder down, then side bend your head to the opposite side and gently put pressure with your other hand to get a stretch through your trapezius muscles. Hold these for 30 seconds and perform 3 times on each side. The final stretch is going to be for your levator scapulae muscle. This is the muscle that is used when you shrug your shoulders, and they can get overworked when you are stressed out. Take your arm on the side of the pain and place it above and behind your shoulder. Then take your opposite arm and place on top and slightly behind your head. Look down towards the opposite knee of the pain and apply gentle pressure for a good stretch. 

DISCLAIMER: Doctor Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy, however, this video is only designed to help you perform the correct technique of exercises that have ALREADY been given to you by your health professional. They are NOT to take the place of going to your own doctor or therapist. There are many manual techniques that a therapist can do that simply can not be done on your own. Your own therapist will also ensure that you are doing correct techniques with your exercises and stretching. If these techniques aren't done right, they won't help, and they could make things worse. So, if you experience any pain while doing these techniques, STOP immediately and see your doctor.","['neck pain', 'stiff neck', 'stoved up', 'neck flexion', 'neck extension', 'crick in neck', 'chiropractor neck pain', 'neck stretches', 'neck exercises', 'neck pain relief', 'yoga for neck pain', 'neck', 'neck traction', 'stiff neck relief', 'neck pain treatment', 'relieve neck pain', 'relief for neck pain', 'neck pain stretches', 'how to relieve neck pain', 'neck pain stretch', 'neck pain cure', 'neck pain remedies', 'tight neck muscles', 'headache in neck', 'tension headache', 'askdoctorjo', 'doctorjo']"

quadratus lumborum stretch - best quadratus lumborum exercise while sitting at your desk,Oia7X33eQBs,Stretch,3.5,33133,370,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oia7X33eQBs,"For our comprehensive article on how to find and treat low back trigger point pain, visit us at https://goo.gl/0C0NVY

A quadratus lumborum stretch may just be the right thing for you if you're suffering from low back pain. This video shows the best quadratus lumborum exercise while sitting at your desk. The quadratus lumborum, or called the 'QL' muscle for short, becomes tight from long periods of inactivity while sitting. Its a deep back muscle that can be easily stretched while sitting. This technique is an excellent way to help reduce tightness on the quadratus lumborum muscle and address its role in various postural dysfunctions.  

For all our videos on treating and finding trigger points, go to our playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZVRPg1iX7OcpetTFQOUSldyECZ4PQDwK

This lower back stretch is effective because it targets all the different muscles of the QL. You see, the QL muscle points out into different directions. If you stretch in only one direction, you may be missing the right angle that will help you fully release the QL muscle. 

Try this quadratus lumborum stretching exercise at work in between your breaks. If you have any muscle knots or trigger points, always make sure you address them through self myofascial treatments before beginning a ql stretch. If you feel the stretch does not provide any pain relief. go back to self treatments (using a trigger point ball, muscle wizard, etc.) and then begin stretching again after 1 to 2 weeks.You may need to do this several times before the stretch provides a more permanent pain relief.

Sitting kills. Multiple studies now support that sitting is the new smoking, with people who sit too long having a 54% increase in heart attack risk.

Even though most of us spend multiple hours on our desk chair every day averaging 9.3 hours of total sitting a day, there is light at the end of the tunnel: Taking frequent breaks at work, to get up and walk or stretch, breaks the vicious sitting cycle and reduces the brutal effects of sitting on our longevity.

That's why I have created the Office Exercise & Stretch app. I did it to help myself get up from my chair more often -- because I too sit for multiple hours a day! It's available on Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitnessreloaded.office_exercise_and_stretch_pro&hl=en) and Windows 8 (http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/office-exercise-stretch/7afa2033-1171-4f2c-8119-e1f11669cee5).

If you're in need of a five-minute full body stretch, then this video is for you!  This routine has 14 stretches, held for 20 second each, that will loosen your major muscle groups from head to toe.

One of the secrets of success with flexibility is having a routine. It doesn’t need to be long or complicated, either. Doing just a few minutes of basic stretches on most days of the week will help prevent the loss of flexibility while keeping your body performing optimally. 

A few quick pointers:
1. Studies show that a great time to stretch is after a cardio workout, when your muscles are warm from the increased blood flow.
2. You should feel a gentle stretch, not pain.
3. Remember to breathe throughout the stretch

Office Workers Guide to Stretching and Ergonomics,hzUStg_pGBE,Stretch,0.92,1861,14,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzUStg_pGBE,"Do you spend your 40-hour work week tied to a desk and chair? If so you're like many Americans. The downfall of computer-based work is the compromise it subjects the body to. We've all seen studies and articles in the news on the negative cardiovascular impact prolonged sitting can have, but what about the musculoskeletal compromise?

Did you know that prolonged sitting can shorten your hamstrings and hip flexors, contribute to neck and low back pain, and even diminish core strength? Without frequent standing/walking breaks, we subject ourselves to significant postural changes and medical issues.

Here are a few tips and exercises for the office worker to maintain a healthy body along with their exercised mind:

Proper Sitting Ergonomics: 
Your ankles should be in neutral with feet flat on the floor, knees bent at 90 degrees, hips bent at 90 degrees, trunk in neutral, shoulders in neutral, elbows bent at 90 degrees resting on armrests, wrists in neutral with keyboard directly underneath the hands, and monitor at eye level so your neck remains neutral and relaxed.

Breaks:
It is recommended to try to take 5-10 minutes every hour to get up, stretch, and move your body.

As always, if these exercises increase your pain at all, or if they don't improve your symptoms after a few days, you will probably benefit from a one-on-one evaluation with a physical therapist.","['Physical Therapy', 'Sports Medicine', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Ivy Rehab', 'Sports Injury', 'Rehabilitation', 'PT', 'office work', 'stretching']"

If you're like a lot of people, your day-to-day activity involves a lot of sitting in a chair at a desk or in a vehicle.  This can leave your muscles tight which can lead to pain and dysfunction.  The good news is, it is very easy to stretch those muscles once or twice a day to help combat the muscle tightness you get from sitting all day. 

In this video, you will see three different stretches you can do in as little as 3-5 minutes anytime during your day to help relieve muscle tightness from sitting:

1) Lower back stretch
2) Hip flexor stretch
3) Chest stretch

Do each of these stretches for about 30-60 seconds once or twice a day to be kind to your muscles.

This 15min Routine is perfect to do on a daily basis, to make sure our muscles and joints are not too stiff from sitting all day long or training a lot. This helps to increase your mobility and flexibility :) 

We will stretch our hamstrings, thighs, hip flexors, back, work on our spine mobility and so on. It’s a „Full Body“ Session

I’m actually super excited for this, since I really need to step up my stretching skills :D and I’m optimistic that I will stick to this better, if I will have a fix video that I can follow haha. This was definitely missing on my channel!

quadratus lumborum stretch - best quadratus lumborum exercise while sitting at your desk,Oia7X33eQBs,Stretch,3.5,33133,370,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oia7X33eQBs,"For our comprehensive article on how to find and treat low back trigger point pain, visit us at https://goo.gl/0C0NVY

A quadratus lumborum stretch may just be the right thing for you if you're suffering from low back pain. This video shows the best quadratus lumborum exercise while sitting at your desk. The quadratus lumborum, or called the 'QL' muscle for short, becomes tight from long periods of inactivity while sitting. Its a deep back muscle that can be easily stretched while sitting. This technique is an excellent way to help reduce tightness on the quadratus lumborum muscle and address its role in various postural dysfunctions.  

For all our videos on treating and finding trigger points, go to our playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZVRPg1iX7OcpetTFQOUSldyECZ4PQDwK

This lower back stretch is effective because it targets all the different muscles of the QL. You see, the QL muscle points out into different directions. If you stretch in only one direction, you may be missing the right angle that will help you fully release the QL muscle. 

Try this quadratus lumborum stretching exercise at work in between your breaks. If you have any muscle knots or trigger points, always make sure you address them through self myofascial treatments before beginning a ql stretch. If you feel the stretch does not provide any pain relief. go back to self treatments (using a trigger point ball, muscle wizard, etc.) and then begin stretching again after 1 to 2 weeks.You may need to do this several times before the stretch provides a more permanent pain relief.

Exercises to prevent back pain: standing hip flexor stretch,5w_WRPqYZW4,Stretch,1.17,4882,30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w_WRPqYZW4,"Back pain is one of the most common reasons people see their doctor. Office workers are vulnerable to prolonged sitting, and thus one of the highest occupations to have complaints of spine discomfort and pain. A few simple exercises at your desk can help alleviate your pain.

Standing hip flexor stretch: This stretch is helpful to stretch the muscle group that becomes tight with prolonged sitting; these muscles have direct attachment to the front part of your spine and when this muscle group is tight, your back also can feel tight. This will assist in limbering up your spine and allowing you to stand taller and walk better.

If you’re in prolonged pain, you should consult your physician to discuss underlying problems or treatment concerns. Call the Comprehensive Spine Center at 614-293-2225 and learn more at http://go.osu.edu/CGS7.

Stretching Workout | Workout @ Work with Jessie Pavelka and BMI Healthcare,N6XTVxXACkA,Stretch,3.87,1379,13,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XTVxXACkA,"The Stretching Workout helps lengthen muscles, reduce muscle tension and can boost energy levels.

International health and wellbeing expert Jessie Pavelka has joined forces with physiotherapists from BMI Healthcare to encourage people across the UK to build simple exercises into their day by taking part in Workout @ Work.

It is hoped those who lead sedentary lives and don't do enough exercise can be inspired to move more at work and make some positive health changes. 

Sitting for long periods without adequate breaks can take a toll on our bodies and minds, leading to sickness or ill health and time away from work. Poor work habits can increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders and can lead to stress, depression or anxiety.

The Workout @ Work programmes of Stretching, Toning and Cardio have been designed by BMI Healthcare physiotherapists and endorsed by Jessie Pavelka (Sky TVs 'Obese: A Year to Save My Life' and 'Fat: The Fight of My Life').

Stop Stretching Your Hip Flexors! (HERE&#39;S WHY),KCADorwJ6Ik,Stretch,8.13,3103437,78724,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCADorwJ6Ik,"Your step by step complete plan - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workouts

The hip flexors are one of the first areas we rush to stretch since they tend to feel tight more often than any other muscle group.  The problem is, tightness can often be confused for weakness and when you stretch a weak muscle you are only making the problem worse.  In this video, I’m going to show you how to determine if your hip flexors are tight or weak and the appropriate approach depending on those findings.

First we need to talk a little bit about anatomy however.  If you have ever had low back pain while doing ab exercises, then you know why the hip flexors are so important.  They originate on the lumbar vertebrae and can pull on your lower back when they get tight.  They can also wreak havoc elsewhere when weak.  Determining whether or not you are dealing with a tight or a weak hip flexor is crucial.

To start however, you have to understand that the hip flexors are not a single muscle group.  Instead, there are 5 muscles that contribute to the act of lifting the hip into flexion.  Three of these (TFL, rectus femoris, and sartorius) originate at the level of the hip and the iliac crest which means that they are at a mechanical advantage to lift the knee to the level of the hip but are at a disadvantage to lift them any higher.  Two other muscles however (the psoas and iliac) are found at a higher origin and are capable of lifting the hip past ninety degrees.

Knowing the difference between these muscles is a crucial step in determining the right course of action once you do your tests.  Speaking of the tests, the first thing you want to do is see if you have a true tightness caused by muscle shortening.  To do this, you are going to perform what is called a Thomas Test.  Start by sitting at the edge of a bench or box with your legs halfway over the edge.  Lean back and pull both legs into your chest and be sure to flatten the lower back against the surface.

From here, slowly drop one leg while tightly hugging the other to your chest.  You want to observe two things about the down leg.  First, is the thigh capable of making contact with the bench and second is the knee able to bend and hang freely at 80 or 90 degrees of flexion.  If you find that either of these is not happening then you will want to straighten your knee and see what happens.  If upon straightening you find that the thigh goes down to the surface, then your tight rectus femoris was what was keeping the leg up and you’d want to stretch that.  If the leg didn’t drop down even after straightening the leg then you are dealing with a tight psoas or iliacus that could benefit from stretching.

The key is however, many times the Thomas Test is normal but the hip still feels as if it should be stretched.  This is usually due to fatigue caused by having a weak hip flexor.  In this case, you want to proceed to testing your strength.  You can do this by either hugging one knee to your chest while standing tall and then releasing it.  If you can hold it above 90 degrees but feel a cramp in the outer hip, then you likely have a high hip flexor weakness in the iliacus or psoas.  If you can’t hold it there and the first place you can gain control of the thigh is at 90 degrees or lower, then once again you likely have a weakness.

Alternatively you can place your foot on a flat surface high enough to place your knee at a starting level above the hip.  From here, lift the foot while standing upright and see if you can hold it off the box for at least 15 seconds without the cramping discussed earlier.  If weak, you can use this as the exercise to strengthen it and can add resistance by placing a band around your foot or ankle.

Bottom line is, it is not smart to randomly stretch a muscle if you are not sure if it is actually tight in the first place.  Instead, take a couple minutes and do a few tests to see what you are really dealing with.

7 MIN STRETCHING EXERCISES AFTER WORKOUT | FULL BODY COOL DOWN FOR RELAXATION &amp; FLEXIBILITY,FlAvRcz0zuY,Stretch,7.15,1191014,14541,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlAvRcz0zuY,"These 7 minute stretching exercises can be done at home ideally after every workout so that you can cool down your full body properly. These stretches are amazing for flexibility and relaxation after workouts. You can do them at night or in the morning!

Stretching after your workout is very important because you want to cool down your body and bring your heart rate down slowly after working hard. You only need a fast routine to help your muscles relax and recover. This is also great to avoid your body to get tense and increase flexibility. 

I like to do these stretching exercises in the morning, after a workout and at night before bed because they help me relax and practice my flexibility at the same time in only 7 minutes! If you have more time at home, feel free to keep going or hold the stretches for longer so that your full body gets into a deeper stretch!

SUMMARY:
- After a month of doing some simple stretching exercises, my back feels less stiff and my muscles have become more flexible. Now even after a long workday, I don’t feel any pain and the knots in my shoulder have disappeared.
- Shortly after I started following my stretching routine, I noticed that it took me less time to fall asleep and I felt much more refreshed in the morning. 
- Because the quality of my sleep was better, I also started to feel more energized throughout the day. Before, it was really difficult for me to stay awake during my long workday and after lunch.
- According to Japanese scientists, poor flexibility is connected with arterial stiffening that leads to high blood pressure. That means that stretching naturally lowers high blood pressure, reducing your level of bad cholesterol. 
- After a month of stretching, I’ve noticed that I have become way less clumsy. I don’t know, maybe it’s in my head, but I swear I have no more random bruises on my legs.
- Stretching has improved my posture, which takes extra stress away from my head, neck, and shoulder muscles. So whenever I feel a headache creeping up on me, I just start doing some exercises at my desk and it saves me from the pain. 
- Bending my body in different positions increases blood flow to the bowels, reducing inflammation and gastritis. After incorporating stretching into my daily routine, my bloating is gone and I just feel lighter. 
- Obviously, if you get rid of that tension, you’ll feel calmer. This is exactly what happened to me thanks to stretching. I have clarity of mind and I don’t waste time or energy anymore on annoying thoughts that make me feel anxious.

Shoulder Stretch to Fix Your Shoulders (GET DEEP!),J9yRiOeVvIM,Stretch,6.83,3352014,61291,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9yRiOeVvIM,"Build bigger shoulders while keeping them healthy with A-X
http://athleanx.com/x/bigger-shoulders-safer-shoulders

Shoulder pain is one of the most common ailments that derail a good workout.  Most often, a few shoulder stretches are all that is needed to not just correct the issue but prevent it from occurring in the first place.  That said, not many know how to properly stretch their shoulder to help stop shoulder pain from killing their workouts.  In this video, I show you one of the most common shoulder maladies that causes discomfort when lifting and how to assess whether you are suffering from it so that you can fix it.

The shoulder joint is wrapped tightly by a fibrous structure called a capsule.  The shoulder capsule has a posterior portion that is responsible for providing integrity and support to the humerus within the ball and socket.  When the muscles surrounding the shoulder get tight (in particular the rotator cuff) those muscles have a tendency to push the head of the humerus forward in the shoulder joint.  Once there, the capsule can begin to adaptively shorten which leads to much more chronic and serious changes in the joint.

To prevent shoulder capsule shrinking and tightness, you must have a way to stretch this structure out.  First however, you need to determine whether or not the tightness you feel is from the capsule or from another muscle or muscles in and around the shoulder.

I show you a posterior capsule test that will help you to figure out what you are dealing with.  Lie on your back with your arm fully internally rotated.  Be sure that you are internally rotating the arm at the shoulder and not just pronating your forearm.  From there, hold your arm perpendicular to the ground at ninety degrees and make sure that your back doesn’t roll and your shoulder blade does not lose contact with the ground.  

Try to bring your arm across your chest.  If you can get the outside of your elbow to cross your chest midline then you likely don’t have a tight posterior capsule and instead are dealing with either a tight posterior delt or lat.  Stretches can be seen for those in future videos here on our channel.

The sleeper stretch as shown in this video is great for stretching out the posterior shoulder capsule and helping you to restore normal mobility within the shoulder joint.  Be sure not to crank on your arm too much during this stretch and aim to complete it a few times each week for 45-60 seconds each time until you get up to 70 degrees of internal rotation back to your shoulder and can almost touch the ground with the fingers on the affected side.

Willkommen zur 15 Minuten Full Body Stretch Einheit! Zu einem ausgewognen Training, gehört auch ausreichend Erholung und Recovery! Daher steht an Tag 7 unserer Fitness-Journey eine wohltuende und ausgleichende Stretching-Routine auf dem Plan. Für mehr Flexibilität, Erholung & Entspannung.

Ja, auch dieses Video kommt ohne Voice-Over ;) Bewusst! Denn entgegen einer geführten Stretching- oder Yoga-Einheit ist man hier wirklich mal ganz bei sich! Nur du, die Musik, dein Atem und ein kleiner Beep hier und da ;) Vielleicht öffnest du dich also heute mal ganz unvoreingenommen für genau diesen Weg. Auch wenn es nur ein einziges Mal ist.
Es wird anders anders sein - davon bin ich überzeugt. Denn wenn es im Aussen still ist, wird es Innen oftmals ganz schön laut.

Ich möchte dich ermutigen, dich einzulassen…
Die Positionen zu genießen und zu erforschen…
Gedanken, die währenddessen aufkommen, einfach zu beobachten…Gut sein zu lassen…Anzunehmen…
Loszulassen…
Zu sein!

Darüberhinaus ist diese Art des Praktizierens ein gute Möglichkeit für einen Übergang zu einer Yoga Self Practise - also das eigenständige Praktizieren.Die Asanas und die Zeit sind vorgegeben, aber die Instruktionen sind dieses Mal dir selbst überlassen.Falls du also schon ein Weilchen mit mir Yoga praktizierst, nutze die heutige „no-talking-session“ doch gerne für eine kleine Bestandsaufnahme in Sachen Ausrichtung und Mindset. 
Was machen die Schultern in der Vorbeuge, wo sind die Hände im Vierfüßler ausgerichtet und wie hieß nochmal der herabschauenden Hund auf Sanskrit… ;)

Das ist nur eine kleiner Impuls meinerseits, denn in meinen Augen bieten uns unterschiedliche Situation nunmal unterschiedlichste Möglichkeiten. Wir müssen nur genau hinschauen und sie wahrnehmen… und annehmen!

Wenn du nicht dennoch sträubst, auch in Ordnung ❤️.
Dann mache stattdessen gerne diese geführte Full Body Stretch Einheit (15 Minuten): https://youtu.be/qFgwrTc1e1I
Wenn du mehr willst, mache 30 Minuten Full Body Stretch: https://youtu.be/FUHzkAbrOlg


Und wenn du dich fragst, was erzählt sie da eigentlich, ich will mich doch einfach nur Dehnen 😂😂😂
Perfekt! Dann bist du genau richtig hier ❤️

Schön, dass du da bist.
Alles Liebe.
Mady 🤘🏼🐾

Stretching is KILLING Your Gains (BIG MISTAKE!),nLQefKzMVjo,Stretch,6.75,2343037,47558,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLQefKzMVjo,"Get jacked in 90 days here - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workouts

Stretching, when done the right way at the wrong time can absolutely be killing your gains.  The issue is that many people do not know the difference between active and static stretching and the impact that doing one over the other before your workout can be having on your strength and ultimately your size gains.  In this video, I’m going to show you why you should not do static stretching that you hold for any length of time before you train if you want to get maximum muscle growth and strength.

The issue boils down to neural efficiency.  When you perform any movement, it doesn’t matter if it is something you would define as an exercise, your body has a stored pattern for accomplishing it.  It does this in order to create movement efficiency.  If I drop a pen on the ground and I bend to pick it up, your body doesn’t have to think about every single joint component of motion that is needed to get you down to the ground.  Instead, it thinks of the “squat” movement in general and is able to instantly help you down to the floor without wasting any time.

When you perform static stretching of muscles that are going to be trained in your workout that day, you are negatively interfering with your stored engrams or motor patterns.  While increasing flexibility and the length of a muscle can be a very good thing long term, doing stretches just prior to your workout that temporarily do this can have this associated downside that winds up costing you gains from your workouts.

The length tension relationship between muscles is something that you have that is unique to you and different from one muscle to the next.  While not all length tension relationships are optimal, it is still what your body is used to and what is being used by it when calling on the stored motor pattern when performing a movement.  Static or passive stretching before a workout will temporarily disrupt these patterns by affecting the actin and myosin cross bridging.  

If you were going to use this method of warming up for a workout, you would then have to spend a significant amount of time prior to starting your training just to attempt to re-integrate the movements to better match up to the engrams stored for that movement pattern or exercise.  In this case, I would suggest doing two or three light sets of each of the exercises you were going to do in that workout after completing the static stretching routine. This could add at least a half an hour to your workout when you account for the stretching and the re-integration.

There is a better way.  You can instead opt to perform active or dynamic stretching for the muscles that are going to be involved in the exercises you are about to perform that day.  These are movement stretches that take your joints actively into new ranges without ever holding for any length of time.  The disruption to the muscles is greatly minimized and your ability to feel loose and perform at a high level is maintained.

That said, static stretching is still vital and has a place in your routine.  The best thing to do is do your stretches for the muscles that you worked that day, later on at night before you go to bed.  When you sleep, your body heals itself and the muscles that were trained tend to heal a bit shorter.  You can lessen this shortening effect by performing the static stretches just before laying down.  When you wake up the next morning you should not only feel more loose but you will likely have less muscle soreness as well.

Thank you!

Michelle Kenway presents a series of neck exercises that focus upon relieving commonly experienced areas of tension. The exercises presented are general neck exercises and should all feel comfortable and pain free. These exercises are not designed to treat specific neck conditions. Never stretch beyond the limits of personal comfort and immediately cease any neck exercises that are associated with any physical discomfort.

This exercise video guides you step by step through a number of basic neck exercises and techniques to relieve  neck and shoulder muscles and improve posture.

Neck exercise 1 - Correct sitting posture for neck stretches

Sit with your spine lengthened and tall by lifting the crown of your head towards the ceiling, raising your sternum slightly and relaxing your shoulders back and down.

Neck exercise 2 - Shoulder rolls

Shoulder rolls relieve tension in the neck and shoulders. This exercise involves circular movements of the shoulder girdle forwards, upwards, backwards and down as if drawing circles with the shoulders. This exercise can be coordinated with breathing, breathing in as you raise your shoulders upwards and exhaling as you roll your shoulders back and down. It can be useful to use this exercise as a technique to relax your neck and shoulders and to set your correct posture.

Neck exercise 3 - Chin to chest

Chin to chest stretch is directed towards stretching the muscles at the back of the neck. Sit tall with your spine lengthened and gently lower your chin towards your chest as you breathe out. Repeat slowly and gently 3-4 times in a row.

Neck exercise 4 - Ear to shoulder stretch

This neck exercise involves directing the ear towards the shoulder to stretch and relieve tension in the muscles at the side of the neck. First correct your posture, stabilise or fix your left shoulder down by taking your left hand to hold under your chair. Slowly lower your right ear to your right shoulder keeping your nose facing forwards throughout. This neck exercise stretches the neck muscles in the left side of your neck. The stretch may be felt anywhere from below the left ear, the left side of the neck and into the left upper shoulder. This stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. 

Neck exercise 5 - Nose to armpit stretch

Nose to armpit stretch is a useful stretch for relieving the muscles that run from the head into the shoulder. First correct your posture, stabilise your shoulder girdle by grasping under the seat of your chair with your left hand and rotate your head towards the right, lowering your nose to your right armpit. You will feel a gentle stretch on the left side of your neck. This stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. Perform this stretch on both sides of the neck.

Neck exercise 6 - Nose to opposite knee 

Nose to opposite knee can stretch and relieve the muscles that run through the back of the neck into the top of the shoulder blade (these muscles lift the shoulder blade). Set your posture and stabilise your left shoulder down by taking your left hand to hold under your chair. Rotate your head slightly to the right and gently lower your nose towards your right knee. Nose to opposite knee stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. Nose to opposite knee can be performed on both sides of the neck.

Upper back/shoulder exercise 7 - Forward reach

To stretch the muscles in your middle back between your shoulder blades, link your fingers together, roll your shoulders forwards and reach out in front of your body. Gently lower your chin to your chest to combine some additional neck stretch exercise.

Chest stretch exercise 8 - Backward reach

To stretch your chest and assist good posture, link your fingers together behind your back. Raise your arms away from your back and lift your chest at the same time. You should feel a gentle stretch across the front of your chest.

Reset your posture to finish

To complete your neck exercises, roll your shoulders in circles a couple of times, coordinate this action with your breathing and reset your posture with your spine straight and your shoulders relaxed and down.","['neck exercises', 'neck stretches', 'Physical Exercise (Word)', 'physical therapist', 'neck stretching exercises', 'neck exercise video', 'exercise video', 'Stretch', 'Stretching (Character Power)', 'Physical Therapy (Medical Specialty)', 'Neck Pain (Symptom)']"

10 Min Office Workout Exercises - Quick Office Workout Routine - How to Workout in Your Office

How to use my workout channel the most efficient way:

Pick what type of look you want to achieve with your training and how you like to train.

You have the following options:

1. I want to lose weight or I have never trained before. I am of a bigger size or I am of small/normal size, but I am too weak or don't have the skills to do workouts. IF THIS IS YOU... then you should do my 4 month weight loss program. This plan teaches you slowly to move your body everyday. Progressing each week so that you can end up with more energy and strength to be able to perform my harder programs. And to get the best results, please do the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 4 month weight loss program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbf0Vo4UlTo&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5ymDN3SdKOvNuJj9xw-n5YE 

2. I want a slim toned type of body and I like doing light toning exercises. I really don't want to build any muscle on my body, but I still want a feminine curvy shape. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT... then you should do my 3 month model program. This plan is based on toning up your whole body and fat burn without building visible muscle. And to get the best results, please follow the meal guide included in this plan.

3. I want a curvy athletic shape with steel abs and a hard ass lol! If you want more visible muscle and possibly a Sixpack, then this is the plan for you. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.... then you should do my 3 month power program. You will build your glutes, six pack and strong arms. To get the the best results, please follow the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 3 month power program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CatXFOgOjDI&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5xQW-6WSemh-5wCc9JqvbKQ

4. I want to get in shape for bikini season and FAST! I want a firmer bum, a flatter stomach and flashy toned arms. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.... then you should do my 8 weeks bikini body guide. To get the the best results, please follow the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 8 week bikini guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WOV7x4eOCQ&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5y135e-4MpXVKdIjZOzM_Jc

5. I just want to start training, get in better shape, but I'm too busy! IF THIS IS YOU... then you should do my 30 days challenge. It's a great way to get in shape without putting too much time on it. You'll train 10-30minutes maximum per day.

As for the meal guides. They are all based around 1500-1600 calories. The only difference is the way of eating, measuring food and how many times a day you'll eat. I recommend you to go through each meal guide and pick one that would suit your type of eating pattern and lifestyle best. You can use one meal guide from another program if that suits your life better.","['1 workout a day', 'fitness blender', 'blogilates', 'fitness', 'office workout exercises', 'office workout for women', 'office workout routine', 'office workout for men', 'office workout videos', 'office workout abs', 'office workout to loose weight', '10 min office workout', '10 minute office workout']"

Prolonged time sitting, working intensely from your home or the office, might lead to stiffness, muscle imbalances and pain in many different areas of your body, such as lower and upper back, neck, shoulders, elbows and wrists. 

These exercises will help you keep active, stretching your muscles and all your joints, increase your blood flow and boosting concentration. They are designed and lead by our Clinical Exercise Physiologist, Dr. Alexsander Guimaraes.  

It's important give yourself five minutes break/movement every hour whilst sitting or working at your desk/computer to keep your body moving, allowing the blood flow and stretching your muscles.

Shoulder Pain Relief Stretches – 5 Minute Real Time Routine,6jHsraw2NIk,Workout,8.08,1158488,27238,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jHsraw2NIk,"These shoulder pain relief stretches are great for helping to relieve general shoulder pain and shoulder tightness. The shoulder stretches are done in real time, so they are easy to follow. Buy a worksheet with these shoulder stretches: https://www.askdoctorjo.com/7-shoulder-stretches-worksheet

In general when stretching the shoulders, you should hold most stretches for 30 seconds, and do them 3 times. Sometimes you might not have enough time to go through your whole routine, which can be time consuming. If you are in a hurry, still hold the shoulder stretches for 30 seconds, but do less reps.

A quick warm up will help warm up and loosen the shoulder muscles to help get them going.

A great way to stretch the shoulder is by stretching out the joint capsule. You can stretch the posterior capsule or a cross arm stretch, and you can stretch the inferior capsule with a triceps stretch.

Also, stretching some of your rotator cuff muscles, like the subscapularis may help relieve the shoulder pain. If going into external rotation of your shoulder is painful, you can modify this stretch.

Finally, a chest or pec stretch and an upper trap stretch will help the shoulder and neck areas.

Can you transcribe this video to a language other than English? 
http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&v=yt3CpkmFAfc
Thank you!

Michelle Kenway presents a series of neck exercises that focus upon relieving commonly experienced areas of tension. The exercises presented are general neck exercises and should all feel comfortable and pain free. These exercises are not designed to treat specific neck conditions. Never stretch beyond the limits of personal comfort and immediately cease any neck exercises that are associated with any physical discomfort.

This exercise video guides you step by step through a number of basic neck exercises and techniques to relieve  neck and shoulder muscles and improve posture.

Neck exercise 1 - Correct sitting posture for neck stretches

Sit with your spine lengthened and tall by lifting the crown of your head towards the ceiling, raising your sternum slightly and relaxing your shoulders back and down.

Neck exercise 2 - Shoulder rolls

Shoulder rolls relieve tension in the neck and shoulders. This exercise involves circular movements of the shoulder girdle forwards, upwards, backwards and down as if drawing circles with the shoulders. This exercise can be coordinated with breathing, breathing in as you raise your shoulders upwards and exhaling as you roll your shoulders back and down. It can be useful to use this exercise as a technique to relax your neck and shoulders and to set your correct posture.

Neck exercise 3 - Chin to chest

Chin to chest stretch is directed towards stretching the muscles at the back of the neck. Sit tall with your spine lengthened and gently lower your chin towards your chest as you breathe out. Repeat slowly and gently 3-4 times in a row.

Neck exercise 4 - Ear to shoulder stretch

This neck exercise involves directing the ear towards the shoulder to stretch and relieve tension in the muscles at the side of the neck. First correct your posture, stabilise or fix your left shoulder down by taking your left hand to hold under your chair. Slowly lower your right ear to your right shoulder keeping your nose facing forwards throughout. This neck exercise stretches the neck muscles in the left side of your neck. The stretch may be felt anywhere from below the left ear, the left side of the neck and into the left upper shoulder. This stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. 

Neck exercise 5 - Nose to armpit stretch

Nose to armpit stretch is a useful stretch for relieving the muscles that run from the head into the shoulder. First correct your posture, stabilise your shoulder girdle by grasping under the seat of your chair with your left hand and rotate your head towards the right, lowering your nose to your right armpit. You will feel a gentle stretch on the left side of your neck. This stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. Perform this stretch on both sides of the neck.

Neck exercise 6 - Nose to opposite knee 

Nose to opposite knee can stretch and relieve the muscles that run through the back of the neck into the top of the shoulder blade (these muscles lift the shoulder blade). Set your posture and stabilise your left shoulder down by taking your left hand to hold under your chair. Rotate your head slightly to the right and gently lower your nose towards your right knee. Nose to opposite knee stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. Nose to opposite knee can be performed on both sides of the neck.

Upper back/shoulder exercise 7 - Forward reach

To stretch the muscles in your middle back between your shoulder blades, link your fingers together, roll your shoulders forwards and reach out in front of your body. Gently lower your chin to your chest to combine some additional neck stretch exercise.

Chest stretch exercise 8 - Backward reach

To stretch your chest and assist good posture, link your fingers together behind your back. Raise your arms away from your back and lift your chest at the same time. You should feel a gentle stretch across the front of your chest.

Reset your posture to finish

To complete your neck exercises, roll your shoulders in circles a couple of times, coordinate this action with your breathing and reset your posture with your spine straight and your shoulders relaxed and down.","['neck exercises', 'neck stretches', 'Physical Exercise (Word)', 'physical therapist', 'neck stretching exercises', 'neck exercise video', 'exercise video', 'Stretch', 'Stretching (Character Power)', 'Physical Therapy (Medical Specialty)', 'Neck Pain (Symptom)']"

Description: Begin in a standing position with stretches that will help open up the chest and stretch the upper back. Then on to slow ham curls with overhead reaches to get the hams stretched out and the blood pumping. Next, side stretches, torso rotating twists, and windmills. Followed by a forward fold where you'll draw a circle with your upper body, stretching the hamstrings, glutes and back. Next, reach tall, lean side to side then dive forward into a forward fold. Finish with a wide stance forward fold where you'll swing side to side, slowly roll up. Finish with a refreshing inhale up and exhale down.

5 Minute Guided Meditation for Gratitude / Mindful Movement,OCorElLKFQE,Meditation,5.95,678789,10212,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCorElLKFQE,"Take 5 minutes out of your busy day to practice the meditation for gratitude.  It is a great guided meditation for first thing in the morning or last thing before you drift off to sleep.

Can you sense the peaceful energy of life flowing through you, invigorating you with each breath? You are the embodiment of this lively energy. Your body is a miracle and a gift, the vehicle through which you have the privilege of experiencing this beautiful world. 

I challenge you to continue cultivating gratitude throughout your day. Perhaps you can even find something positive out of an experience that seems negative at first glance. 

We hope you enjoy!

--- Guided Meditation Script
Bring yourself into a comfortable seated or lying position, and when you feel settled,  gently close your eyes... Start with a few deep relaxing breaths... Breathing in through your nose... and out thru your mouth... Deep cleansing breaths... Feeling your belly expand fully on each in-breath... And feeling all the air leaving your body on the out-breath... (10 second pause) And on your next exhale, returning to your normal breathing rhythm... In and out thru your nose... Just watching the flow of your breath... Without trying to alter or change it in any way...  Just noticing it for its full cycle it as it moves through your body....Become aware of the change in temperature at the tip of your nose...  
Perhaps noticing that the air is slightly cooler on the inhalation than it is on the exhalation...Feel your chest and belly as they gently rise with each in-breath....And on each exhale, feeling your body soften as it releases any tension you’ve been holding onto...Imagining that with each in breath, your body is filling with vitalizing white light... And on each out-breath, that it’s melting into the comfort and support of your position........Your whole body, fully melted into relaxation....  Completely supported...  completely at ease........Now begin to imagine that with each inhalation your body is becoming lighter....Feeling your body gently filling with air, and becoming lighter and lighter with each in-breath...Having your body feeling so light, it‘s almost as if you are floating just up off of the ground....Completely at ease...  completely relaxed... completely rested....Now, take your awareness to the space in front of your closed eyes....  and just watch this space as you continue to breathe....What is it you can see here?...Perhaps you can only see darkness?...  Or maybe you can see colours... or patterns?...  Or images.... Maybe you can even see some movement...Just observe this space with your mind’s eye..... 
and allow your imagination to take over..... (5 second pause) Bringing your awareness back to the rhythmic flow of your breath... And preparing to count the breath. 1’ ..... Feeling fully rested 2’ .....Feeling restored and alert. And 3’ ...... Feeling Revitalized and ready to take on the rest of your day.

❖ Meditation and Mental Health
Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. In the demanding and fast-paced lives that will lead today, mental health is affecting more and more of us every day. While there are many forms of meditation, the ultimate goal is a feeling of relaxation and inner peace, which can help to improve mental health. And there's a growing body of research to support that.

❖ What is Short Meditation?
Throughout our days, we are usually rushed off our feet. Our brains are constantly working. We have little time to think clearly. Even when we go to sleep, a million thoughts run through our minds.
Short Meditation is a technique that a person will practice (usually daily) to clear their mind and to become present in the moment; which, in return will allow them to become more focused and awake. 
There many different ways to meditate to achieve a state of zen.

Check out our Short Meditation Playlist:

5 Minute Guided Meditation for Inner Peace and Calm,C7xRuGVfTPU,Meditation,6.18,6876,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7xRuGVfTPU,"Does it sometimes feel like your thoughts are running on a hamster wheel in your mind? Give me a thumbs up if this has happened to you!

This 5 minute guided meditation for inner peace and calm will give you a break from the chaos in your mind by teaching your brain how to relax so you can feel *more* inner peace and calm *more* of the time.

Here's a quick tip, this meditation is not about clearing out the thoughts. It's your mind's function to think, so I promise you, you're not ""bad"" at meditation. It's also really important that your body is comfortable -- otherwise, your mind simply won't relax. So here's permission to lie down on your back, or your side, or sit in a chair or on the floor. 

After you practice this 5 minute guided meditation for inner peace and calm, I'd love to hear about your experience. Share with me in the comments!

I believe that meditation changes the chemistry in our bodies, energy around us, our reality and our lives for the better. The more we can find space and time for it the better we are off. We also become very in tune with ourselves and with the world here and beyond (sixth sense). I understand that many of us are on the 'GO' and rushing and may not find 20 or 30 minutes to meditate. How about 5 minutes? That is all it takes to invite more peace and calm into your life and get on with your day, that is all it takes to initiate the change the wellbeing of our bodies and to improve the reality around us.
You are worth all 60 minutes and more but if you do not have that time today 5 minutes is better than 0 😊 Find a quiet space, where you will not be disturbed just for 5 minutes and let your Inner Peace grow 🙌

❖ Meditation and Mental Health
Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. In the demanding and fast-paced lives that will lead today, mental health is affecting more and more of us every day. While there are many forms of meditation, the ultimate goal is a feeling of relaxation and inner peace, which can help to improve mental health. And there's a growing body of research to support that.

❖ What is Short Meditation?
Throughout our days, we are usually rushed off our feet. Our brains are constantly working. We have little time to think clearly. Even when we go to sleep, a million thoughts run through our minds.
Short Meditation is a technique that a person will practice (usually daily) to clear their mind and to become present in the moment; which, in return will allow them to become more focused and awake. 
There many different ways to meditate to achieve a state of zen.

5 Reasons To Meditate

Understand your pain: Mental pain and anxiety are a background noise that can underlie much of what we do. Here’s a chance to see firsthand what’s causing it.

Lower stress: There’s lots of evidence these days that excess stress causes lots of illnesses and makes other illnesses worse. Mindfulness decreases stress.

Connect better: Ever find yourself staring blankly at a friend, lover, child, and you’ve no idea what they’re saying? Mindfulness helps you give them your full attention.

Improve focus: It can be frustrating to have our mind stray off what we’re doing and be pulled in six directions. Meditation hones our innate ability to focus.

Reduce brain chatter: The nattering, chattering voice in our head seems never to leave us alone. Isn’t it time we gave it a little break?

5 Minute Guided Meditation for Gratitude / Voice Only Meditation / Mindful Movement,niYf1Uzb-OQ,Meditation,5.95,9232,231,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niYf1Uzb-OQ,"This is the voice only version of this meditation.
Take 5 minutes out of your busy day to practice the meditation for gratitude.  It is a great guided meditation for first thing in the morning or last thing before you drift off to sleep.

Can you sense the peaceful energy of life flowing through you, invigorating you with each breath? You are the embodiment of this lively energy. Your body is a miracle and a gift, the vehicle through which you have the privilege of experiencing this beautiful world. 

I challenge you to continue cultivating gratitude throughout your day. Perhaps you can even find something positive out of an experience that seems negative at first glance. 

We hope you enjoy!

Guided Mindfulness Meditation- 5 minutes of Relaxation,JGZhGkfm9BQ,Meditation,7.07,72274,332,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGZhGkfm9BQ,"http://qigongforvitality.com

Here is a simple mindfulness meditation that you can easily do at home, or at work. We are so busy nowadays and it is good to just stop for a few minutes to get centered and calm. Sometimes we think that we can't relax because we have too much to do. In fact we HAVE to relax BECAUSE we have so much to do!

Just listen to the simple instructions, then you'll hear a bell tone and 5 minutes of music. Just close your eyes, breathe naturally, and keep your attention on your body. The meditation will finish with the bell tone again.
Enjoy and let me know what you think!

Improve focus: It can be frustrating to have our mind stray off what we’re doing and be pulled in six directions. Meditation hones our innate ability to focus.

Reduce brain chatter: The nattering, chattering voice in our head seems never to leave us alone. Isn’t it time we gave it a little break?

But in reality—especially when your phone is your alarm—it’s what’s there, pulling you out of peaceful slumber and racing toward the realities of your day.

To capture—or recapture—the stillness of that first moment of wakefulness, Austin-based yoga and meditation instructor Kate Waitzkin recorded a ten-minute guided meditation focused on clarity, stability, and presence for us. We like to listen to this morning meditation while we’re still in bed. But you can play it anytime you’re looking to center yourself in the present and find some clarity and stability.

Urgency
We often feel the need to rush and complete tasks to move onto the next one. To make decisions by a certain time. This feeling of urgency, a pressure that causes us to act without considering our natural process of movement is a form of anxiety. Urgency can lead to panic attacks as well as anxiety attacks. In this free 10 minute guided meditation we employ guided positive energy and vibrations by calmly the urgency and anxiety as well as address the rumination of overthinking (i.e., over analyzing) OCD (Obsessive compulsive Disorder).

Anxiety and Anxiety Attacks
There are many remedies for physical trauma but few for the emotional trauma's that we experience. Some of the root of Anxiety can be traced to physical medical condition, although I practice that all anxiety is physical, even if the root stems from an emotional experience. Anxiety has a foot print can be tracked. In this 10 minute guided meditation we use positive healing energy through meditation to follow a peaceful path away from anxiety, panic attacks, urgency, compulsive disorder, worry and fear to arrive at our peace within.

Using Guided Meditations for Anxiety:
Meditation has been scientifically proven beneficial for those who experience and even suffer from Anxiety. Meditation for anxiety, like out Positive Meditations, can transform the listeners experience and cause the mind to abandon anxiety impulses for a more peaceful and calming experience.

We write and create high quality Guided Meditations videos that are freely viewable on YouTube. We have been creating these meditations since 2009.

The meditations were begun with one purpose: simply to try and help people. Every meditation is produced with genuine care and love for those people who use them, because we too have needed the kind of help our meditations are trying to offer others.

Our ethos is to be as all-inclusive and as neutral as possible. We have no religious or other affiliations and try to keep most of our meditations suitable for everyone. We always welcome comments, feedback & suggestions and actively engage with our subscribers via our Facebook page.

This guided meditation will take you on a journey of relaxation by simply inviting you to focus on your breath.  As you first close your eyes, let this be a signal to your body to relax, then follow the sound of my voice to guide you deeper into a relaxed state.  Let my voice go with you throughout your day to help you relax and let go.  

Your breath is a wonderful focal point because it is always with you and you can tap into it any time you need, whether during meditation or in your activities of daily life.  This practice will strengthen your ability to be present outside of meditation.  You will clear the clutter of your mind to calm you.   It will reduce your stress level,  as well as improve your overall health and well being when practiced regularly.  

**For a powerful experience to help calm the overactive, overthinking mind, this meditation can be paired with this sleep practice to help you calm your mind before bed:  https://youtu.be/jcprGTfC4vc

A meditation for beginners and all levels and spiritual paths that will help you not only release tension and stress but it will also allow you to begin to deepen your practice in mindfulness and to train your mind for calm detachment from any unwanted patterns of over-thinking.  


By practicing these mindful techniques of conscious observation and self acceptance, you will find you are more able to quiet the mind and truly give yourself permission to dedicate time in your day for your mind and soul. 

Put on some headphones, close your eyes, and enjoy this 15 minute guided meditation.

Cultivate an Attitude of Gratitude with this 15 Minute Guided Meditation  / Mindful Movement,M6SHrfnaIoY,Meditation,15.83,115275,2205,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6SHrfnaIoY,"Adopting an attitude of gratitude has a profound effect and the potential to completely change your state of being in just a moment's time.  The practice of a gratitude meditation can spread around the world and the positive energy has no boundaries!  

Your body is a miracle and a gift, the vehicle through which you have the privilege of experiencing this beautiful world. 

I challenge you to continue cultivating gratitude throughout your day. Perhaps you can even find something positive out of an experience that seems negative at first glance. 

Notice how your breath is expanding in connection with the growing feeling of love.  Give yourself permission to simply be here, enjoying everything that comes to the surface as you soften and open to gratitude.  Notice how you feel with acceptance as you develop a deeper state of awareness and connection. Experience your breath tenderly, gently, taking special care of yourself as you open into the vulnerability of love.

When you are clear about what is important to you and live intentionally, you find clarity.  

This meditation is a ritual to be practiced daily, first thing in the morning.  You can use me as your guide, or choose to practice on your own.  It allows you to continue to focus on your values so that you can make choices and have interactions with yourself and other people that are in alignment with these values.  Knowing your intentions invites you to be authentic.  
This practice can change the way you interpret experience and therefore how you respond.  It allows you to see what is happening, be ok with it, so you can look deeper, understand it and find meaning in your experience. 

You can pair this practice with an evening meditation ritual for powerful effects: https://youtu.be/ZFt1HN53VBw

Dealing with Thoughts During Meditation: A 15 Minute Guided Mindfulness Meditation,2iH_gqDaEv8,Meditation,15.47,44634,1040,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iH_gqDaEv8,"It is your mind’s job to think, yet thoughts can seem to “get in the way” or be seen as a distraction when practicing meditation.  This is true for first-time meditators as well as long-time practitioners.  It is simply how the mind works.  So the next logical question is, how do you deal with thoughts during meditation?  I will guide you on this practice today.  
Be patient and compassionate with yourself during this process and know that thoughts, like breath, will rise and fall.  Simply knowing this fact is the first step to increasing your ability to avoid getting stuck in thoughts during meditation and in life.

I will start with a quote to contemplate from the book “Peace is Every Step,” by Thich Nhat Hanh. 

“In us, there is a river of feelings in which every drop of water is a different feeling, and each feeling relies on all the others for its existence.  To observe it, we just sit on the bank of the river and identify each feeling as it surfaces, flows by, and disappears.”

Awaken a Renewal of Energy with this 15 Minute Guided Meditation / Nature&#39;s Lessons Series,7o9HZyHgzU4,Meditation,15.63,19216,460,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o9HZyHgzU4,"Today's practice is about exploring the lessons offered to us by Mother nature when we are willing to listen and learn.  The cycle of the seasons, year after year, has a lot to teach us. Each season has meaning and can invite contemplation of the connections of nature to our own experiences.  

The symbolism of spring brings the promise of renewal, like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon.  The flowers are blossoming, they are reaching and growing, they are growing towards the light.  The light each day is growing longer.  There is an energy of abundance and new growth.  

During this 15-minute mindfulness meditation, you can enjoy bringing your awareness to your breath, a relaxed scan of your body, and plenty of stress-relieving introspection as you contemplate the lessons of the season of Spring.  

We hope you enjoy!

Don't worry about always being still, always being thought-free or meditating ""perfectly"". Simply sit and breathe, that's it! Over time the spaces between your thoughts will distance themselves but there's no need to rush or force it.

Make sure you are sitting comfortably, either on a block or a few blankets. You can even sit on a chair if sitting on a floor doesn't work for you! I hope you enjoy this simple and straightforward guided meditation :)

Join Sara Raymond from the Mindful Movement as she guides on this 15-minute mindfulness meditation for beginners.  You can gain a lot from meditation with a beginner's mindset.

Frequently, not knowing the right way to meditate or the possibility of not “doing” it perfectly may be discouraging when beginning a practice.  In reality, meditation is not a destination, it is a journey.  It is not about the outcome, it is about the process, about the curiosity you bring to what is there for you right now. There is no wrong way to do it.  

Practice makes progress, not perfect.  Meditation, like learning any new skill takes practice, perseverance, and patience.  Keep showing up, keep practicing.

I hope you enjoy!
Do not listen while driving.

"15 Minute Guided Visualization Meditation, Guided Imagery Meditation Relaxation Exercise",vsxojd4aNdI,Meditation,15.27,697,17,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsxojd4aNdI,"🎧 Guided Imagery Meditation Exercise, Visualization Relaxation (15 Min, Ocean Sounds)
This is a visualization relaxation exercise that you can use to relax and relieve stress. You can use it at any time just as an exercise to enjoy, or you can use it last thing at night when you are trying to get to sleep.

Guided imagery meditation exercises help reduce anxiety, stress, fatigue, restlessness, difficulty sleeping and physical discomfort. Visualization is another powerful technique that can help you unwind and relieve stress. Visualization meditation involves using mental imagery to achieve a more relaxed state of mind. Similar to daydreaming, visualization is accomplished through the use of your imagination.

Do not listen to this whilst driving or operating machinery, only when you can safely relax!

Before beginning any of these visualization exercises, make sure your environment is set up for your comfort. To better relax, eliminate any distractions, such as phones, pets or television. Try to find a quiet place where you will most likely be undisturbed. Remove any heavy jewelry or restricting clothing, such as tight belts or scarves. Get ready to relax by either sitting or lying down in a position that feels most comfortable to you.

15 Minute Guided Meditation w Breath Assistance | 4K UHD &quot;Just Breathe&quot; by Nature Relaxation™,itC47I7s5Bs,Meditation,15.22,31107,401,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itC47I7s5Bs,"http://www.NatureRelaxation.com / http://watch.naturerelaxation.com | ABOUT: The first attempt at new series of professional and powerful guided meditation videos from Nature Relaxation, ""Just Breathe"" is a simple introductory meditation introducing the basics of meditation: focusing on our breath and letting our thoughts not control us, so we can achieve a state of deep calm - something directly linked to many health benefits related to the heart, body and mind! MORE INFO: The world is full of things that make us stressed, anxious, and zap us of our creative energy. Unfortunately as human beings, there is no getting away from this. But also as human beings, we are equipped with the tools we need to restore a sense of calm, peace, and perspective. That's what meditation is all about.  And that's what this video was created to help you with: making your mind more peaceful and focused by using the power of your breathe to calm your mind. Beautiful scenes of 4K nature help naturally lower your heart rate, thus boosting your relaxation response. Give it a try and let me know what you think! And if you liked it, PLEASE share your comments so we can factor them in for the many more meditations I will be releasing soon.

Guided meditation is a form of meditation where an individual is verbally guided into a state of consciousness either by a person’s live voice or by a recording of a voice. This process and practice of meditation requires an individual to follow verbal instructions that teach the individual how to relax the entire body, clear the mind, concentrate on breathing, and focus one’s awareness and attention. What one chooses to explore when meditating all depends on the individual’s intentions, needs, and level of interest and passion.

Mindfulness is ""the intentional, accepting and non-judgemental focus of one's attention on the emotions, thoughts and sensations occurring in the present moment"", which can be trained by meditational practices derived from Buddhist anapanasati.

Mindfulness practice is being employed in psychology to alleviate a variety of mental and physical conditions, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and in the prevention of relapse in depression and drug addiction. It has gained worldwide popularity as a distinctive method to handle emotions.","['nature relaxation', 'harmony', 'peace', 'anxiety relief', 'stress relief', 'natural', 'hollistic', 'brain training', 'mental conditioning', 'healing nature', 'meditation aid', 'high definition', 'nature video', 'guided meditation imagery', 'nature meditation guided', 'breathing help', 'breathwork training', 'breath pacer', 'sleep aid', 'meditation training', 'meditation help', 'fiji islands', '4k uhd meditation']"
15 Minute Guided Breathing Meditation for Relaxation and Inner Stillness,4Undv6MmQeE,Meditation,16.97,7981,210,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Undv6MmQeE,"To skip intro click here: 0:33

This is a short guided meditation, focussing on using the breath to experience inner stillness. This is perfect when you're feeling overwhelmed, anxious, stressed or tired. It very quickly helps you relax your nervous system, connect with your breath and sink into a deep inner stillness beneath the breath.

If you'd like a longer version of this meditation, here's a 40 minute version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTJSJckA-oY&feature=youtu.be

You can sit or lie down...

If you’re on the floor:
Sit with your legs crossed. Sit on the edge of a big cushion (or a couple of pillows) so that your hips are slightly higher than your knees (this helps keep your back upright and supports your lower back). Rest your hands wherever they feel most comfortable on your knees, thighs or in your lap. 

If you’re on a chair:
Sit with your legs at least shoulder width apart with the soles of your feet flat against the floor (or with your legs crossed meditation style if the seat is big enough and you're comfortable). Sit with your back unsupported or supported by the back of the chair with a cushion in the small of your back. Rest your hands wherever they feel most comfortable on your knees, thighs or in your lap. 

Lying down:
Lie on your back. If you have any trouble with your lower back try placing a pillow beneath your knees, or lie with your knees bent towards the ceiling and the soles of your feet flat on the surface you're lying on. Rest your hands by your sides, or resting lightly on your lower stomach.

Is it better to sit on the floor, a chair or lie down? - This depends on how you're best able to find a balance between being comfortable and alert. Meditation is a state of both relaxation and focussed attention, so find a position that you will be as comfortable as possible in as well as being able to focus on your breathing without falling asleep (unless you want to of course!).

Thanks for listening.

As you listen you learn to value the transient nature of life and realize that you can tolerate anything for the moment. It's great for those who may have tried silent meditation and found it difficult. Traditionally, mindfulness meditation is done with your eyes closed.  However, the video offers you the ability to refocus your thoughts should you feel the need to open your eyes. 15 Minutes

😌KEEP CALM and STAY FOCUSED - Short guided meditation for focus and concentration,cDV7z__ARx0,Meditation,6.6,2108,62,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDV7z__ARx0,"Ever find yourself with so much to do that you don’t know what to focus on? This simple guided meditation will help you keep calm and stay focused on your most important work.  

Sometimes having so many choices can lead to analysis paralysis.  So cut the distractions and listen to your intuition’s quiet knowledge.  You might think taking a short break for a meditation is counterproductive, but not true, taking a break from a task can make you more productive.  

This is a short guided meditation for focus and concentration.  So useful when studying, but also helpful for anytime when you need a little more clarity about your next task.  It will help you work at your optimum by clearing out unwanted distractions.  You know, things like negative thoughts, other people's opinions and your own unhelpful judgements.  

Keep calm and stay focused ....good luck!

❤ Clare

5 Minute Guided Meditation for Gratitude / Mindful Movement,OCorElLKFQE,Meditation,5.95,678789,10212,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCorElLKFQE,"Take 5 minutes out of your busy day to practice the meditation for gratitude.  It is a great guided meditation for first thing in the morning or last thing before you drift off to sleep.

Can you sense the peaceful energy of life flowing through you, invigorating you with each breath? You are the embodiment of this lively energy. Your body is a miracle and a gift, the vehicle through which you have the privilege of experiencing this beautiful world. 

I challenge you to continue cultivating gratitude throughout your day. Perhaps you can even find something positive out of an experience that seems negative at first glance. 

We hope you enjoy!

But in reality—especially when your phone is your alarm—it’s what’s there, pulling you out of peaceful slumber and racing toward the realities of your day.

To capture—or recapture—the stillness of that first moment of wakefulness, Austin-based yoga and meditation instructor Kate Waitzkin recorded a ten-minute guided meditation focused on clarity, stability, and presence for us. We like to listen to this morning meditation while we’re still in bed. But you can play it anytime you’re looking to center yourself in the present and find some clarity and stability.

Short Mindfulness Meditation--Reduce Stress and Anxiety in 6 Minutes,ml_rbk_qDEQ,Meditation,6.58,77730,1315,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml_rbk_qDEQ,"Take 6 minutes to reset, reduce stress and anxiety, and connect with yourself in the present moment with this short, basic mindfulness meditation.  

The Buddha once said: “Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.”  This represents the idea of mindfulness.  When we practice being mindful, we bring our attention to the present moment, and this is the only moment we can ever be sure of.  

Today we will experience the practice of mindfulness in meditation so that you might more easily take this state into all that you do.

Our knowledge of the brain is evolving at a breathtaking pace, and Dr. Lara Boyd is positioned at the cutting edge of these discoveries. In 2006, she was recruited by the University of British Columbia to become the Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology and Motor Learning. Since that time she has established the Brain Behaviour Lab, recruited and trained over 40 graduate students, published more than 80 papers and been awarded over $5 million in funding. 

Dr. Boyd’s efforts are leading to the development of novel, and more effective, therapeutics for individuals with brain damage, but they are also shedding light on broader applications. By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless possibility.

The secret to winning an argument isn't grand rhetoric or elegant style, says US Supreme Court litigator Neal Katyal -- it takes more than that. With stories of some of the most impactful cases he's argued before the Court, Katyal shows why the key to crafting a persuasive and successful argument lies in human connection, empathy and faith in the power of your ideas. ""The question is not how to win every argument,"" he says. ""It's how to get back up when you do lose.""

His most recent book, Deep Work, argues that focus is the new I.Q. in the modern workplace and that the ability to concentrate without distraction is becoming increasingly valuable. He previously wrote So Good They Can’t Ignore You, a book which debunks the long-held belief that “follow your passion” is good advice, and three popular books of unconventional advice for students.

You're not at your best when you're stressed. In fact, your brain has evolved over millennia to release cortisol in stressful situations, inhibiting rational, logical thinking but potentially helping you survive, say, being attacked by a lion. Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin thinks there's a way to avoid making critical mistakes in stressful situations, when your thinking becomes clouded — the pre-mortem. ""We all are going to fail now and then,"" he says. ""The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be.""

And how can we overcome it? Johann Hari has seen our current methods fail firsthand, as he has watched loved ones struggle to manage their addictions. He started to wonder why we treat addicts the way we do — and if there might be a better way. As he shares in this deeply personal talk, his questions took him around the world, and unearthed some surprising and hopeful ways of thinking about an age-old problem.

Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. “The universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance”, says master Yi.  And as for flying – yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020.

The three secrets of resilient people | Lucy Hone | TEDxChristchurch,NWH8N-BvhAw,Educational,16.35,982077,21334,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWH8N-BvhAw,"Dr Lucy Hone is a resilience expert who thought she found her calling supporting people to recover following the Christchurch earthquake. She had no idea that her personal journey was about to take her to a far darker place. In this powerful and courageous talk, she shares the three strategies that got her through an unimaginable tragedy⁠—and offers a profound insight on human suffering. Dr Lucy Hone is a director of the New Zealand Institute of Wellbeing & Resilience, a research associate at AUT University, a published academic researcher, best-selling author and contributor to Psychology Today, the Sunday Star Times and Next magazine. 

She trained at the University of Pennsylvania and got her PhD in public health at AUT University in Auckland. She has helped a range of organisations—from primary schools to leading law firms—to design and implement wellbeing initiatives creating sustained and meaningful change. 

Five years ago, the sudden death of Lucy’s 12-year-old daughter Abi forced Lucy to turn her academic training and professional practice to foster resilience in very personal circumstances. The blog she wrote in the aftermath of Abi’s death attracted international attention and resulted in the best-selling non-fiction title, What Abi Taught Us, Strategies for Resilient Grieving (Allen & Unwin, 2016), now available as Resilient Grieving in the US, UK and NZ.

"Why I, as a black man, attend KKK rallies. | Daryl Davis | TEDxNaperville",ORp3q1Oaezw,Educational,18.88,8864296,389032,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw,"A chance encounter with members of the Ku Klux Klan led black musician Daryl Davis on a quest to determine the source of the hate. His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.

Daryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley’s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.

In 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.

Since his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a “certificate of friendship” from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He’s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly’s granddaughter.

Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations. He is also an actor with stage and screen credits, appearing in the critically acclaimed HBO police drama, The Wire, and most recently, as the subject of the documentary Accidental Courtesy, which filmed his real life encounters with Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leaders as he helps to dismantle racism across the United States

In 1998, says Monica Lewinsky, “I was Patient Zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously.” Today, the kind of online public shaming she went through has become a constant. In a brave talk, she takes a look at our “culture of humiliation,” in which online shame equals dollar signs — and demands a different way.

Graham Hancock - The War on Consciousness BANNED TED TALK,Y0c5nIvJH7w,Educational,18.75,4019991,119314,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0c5nIvJH7w,"Re-uploaded as TED have decided to censor Graham and remove this video from the TEDx youtube channel.

Graham's Website: https://grahamhancock.com/

GRAHAM HANCOCK is the author of the major international bestsellers The Sign and The Seal, Fingerprints of the Gods, and Heaven's Mirror. His books have sold more than five million copies worldwide and have been translated into 27 languages. His public lectures, radio and TV appearances, including two major TV series for Channel 4 in the UK and The Learning Channel in the US - Quest For The Lost Civilisation and Flooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age - have put his ideas before audiences of tens of millions. He has become recognised as an unconventional thinker who raises controversial questions about humanity's past.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Hancock's early years were spent in India, where his father worked as a surgeon. Later he went to school and university in the northern English city of Durham and graduated from Durham University in 1973 with First Class Honours in Sociology. He went on to pursue a career in quality journalism, writing for many of Britain's leading newspapers including The Times, The Sunday Times, The Independent, and The Guardian. He was co-editor of New Internationalist magazine from 1976-1979 and East Africa correspondent of The Economist from 1981-1983.

In the early 1980's Hancock's writing began to move consistently in the direction of books. In 1987 Hancock began work on his widely-acclaimed critique of foreign aid, Lords of Poverty, which was published in 1989.

Hancock's breakthrough to bestseller status came in 1992 with the publication of The Sign and The Seal, his epic investigation into the mystique and whereabouts today of the lost Ark of the Covenant. 'Hancock has invented a new genre,' commented The Guardian, 'an intellectual whodunit by a do-it-yourself sleuth.' Fingerprints of the Gods, published in 1995 confirmed Hancock's growing reputation. Described as 'one of the intellectual landmarks of the decade' by the Literary Review, this book has now sold more than three million copies and continues to be in demand all around the world. Subsequent works such as Keeper Of Genesis (The Message of the Sphinx in the US) with co-author Robert Bauval, and Heaven's Mirror, with photographer Santha Faiia, have also been Number 1 bestsellers.

In 2002 Hancock published Underworld: Flooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age to great critical acclaim, and hosted the accompanying major TV series. This was the culmination of years of research and on-hand dives at ancient underwater ruins. Arguing that many of the clues to the origin of civilization lay underwater, on coastal regions once above water but flooded at the end of the last Ice age, Underworld offered tangible archaeological evidence that myths and legends of ancient floods were not to be dismissed out of hand. Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith, co-authored by Robert Bauval, was published in 2004. This work, returns to the themes last dealt with in Keeper Of Genesis, seeking further evidence for the continuation of a secret astronomical cult into modern times. It is intellectual journey through the back streets and rat runs of history to uncover the traces in architecture and monuments of a secret religion that has shaped the world.

In 2005 Graham published Supernatural: Meetings with The Ancient Teachers of Mankind, an investigation of shamanism and the origins of religion. This  book suggests that experiences in altered states of consciousness have played a fundamental role in the evolution of human culture, and that other realities - indeed parallel worlds - surround us all the time but are not normally accessible to our senses.

In a warm, personal talk, he shares his effort to reconcile who he is with who the world tells him a man should be. And he has a challenge for men: ""See if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper,"" he says. ""Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Are you brave enough to be vulnerable? Are you strong enough to be sensitive? Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life?""

How to make stress your friend | Kelly McGonigal,RcGyVTAoXEU,Educational,14.48,10625955,156526,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGyVTAoXEU,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized talk recommendations and more.

Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive, and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: reaching out to others.

Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a clade within Apoikozoa as the sister group to the choanoflagellates. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.

Most known animal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, about 542 million years ago. Animals can be divided broadly into vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates have a backbone or spine (vertebral column), and amount to less than five percent of all described animal species. They include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The remaining animals are the invertebrates, which lack a backbone. These include molluscs (clams, oysters, octopuses, squid, snails); arthropods (millipedes, centipedes, insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, lobsters, shrimp); annelids (earthworms, leeches), nematodes (filarial worms, hookworms), flatworms (tapeworms, liver flukes), cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, corals), ctenophores (comb jellies), and sponges. The study of animals is called zoology.","['Baby animal', 'Baby animals', 'Animals baby', 'Funny baby animals', 'Cute baby animals', 'Funny animals', 'Funny animal', 'Cute animals', 'Cute animal', 'Baby', 'Animal', 'Cute', 'Funny', 'Cute baby', 'Funny baby', 'Funny animal videos', 'Cute animal videos', 'Baby animal videos', 'Funny videos', 'Cute videos', 'Baby videos', 'Animales', 'Bebes', 'Animales bebes', 'Animales bebes videos', 'Videos animales', 'Bebes videos', 'Baby animals compilation', 'Cute compilation', 'Funny compilation', 'Video compilation', 'Videos', 'Compilation']"

Alone. Alone is what this man is. Years after the world ended and the human race perished; this is the only man left standing. How did he survive? What caused the outbreak? We don't know. No one does. This short film gives you an inside look on what the only man left alive does on a day-to-day basis, what he does to survive, kill time, and keep himself sane.

Just because your partner doesn’t say I love you several times a day, it doesn’t mean you don’t have an amazing relationship. Stop obsessing over certain words or lack thereof, and if you feel a certain way, just ask/talk to your partner.  In the beginning of a relationship, filling in the blanks makes you happy as you are “winning” your partner’s love and all your hard work is paying off, however sustaining this bond is the ultimate key to happiness....

Royal Stag Barrel Select Large Short Films | Call Him Eddy | Sanjay Suri | Eisha Chopra,WnNJaYYF16M,Short Movie,20.4,1458579,27654,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnNJaYYF16M,"Every comedian has grown from a dark valley in his/her life. Similarly, a professional cuddler goes through a lot of emotional void in life which helps him to understand other person’s needs. In India, it is still not a profession nor it is legal but there are places in the world where cuddling helps a lot of people and is considered to be a stress buster/therapy. Cuddling is an emotion.

‘Call him Eddy’ is about a professional cuddler in India. Riya, a producer/documentary filmmaker, visits Eddy as she hears about him from friends and people around her. Riya thinks he’s a scam and it’s just another way of making quick money. The film revolves around these two characters. 

Will Riya’s perception change? Or was she right about him? Watch the movie to find out.

Nanti kamu akan sadar kebahagiaan tidak bisa diakumulasikan. Apa yang terakumulasi bisa terhancurkan oleh waktu. Dan dunia ini penuh dengan orang-orang baik. Jika kamu tidak dapat menemukannya, jadilah salah satunya. begitupun kebahagiaan, jika kamu tidak bisa menemukan ke bahagaian maka jadilah kebahagiaan untuk orang lain. Nikmatilah hal-hal kecil dalam hidupmu karena suatu hari nanti ketika kamu melihat ke belakang kamu akan menyadari itu adalah hal-hal besar.

'I've often heard movies described as “life…minus the boring parts.” It’s a somewhat succinct summation of cinema, but, ultimately, it makes sense. Movies trim the fat—the mundanity of every day life—and only focus on the important bits, which is why in mainstream movies, typically, menial tasks aren’t shown in their entirety.

Subverting that trope is the basis of Kirk Larsen’s clever comedic two hander—Dig Your Own Grave. A lot of folks die in movies, and, usually, lots of bodies need to be disposed of in the desert (or other remote places). The thing is: digging a grave is hard…really f-cking hard. Larsen’s central pitch is what if some bad boy mafioso’s one liner actually had to be carried out to its logical conclusion. By taking things literally, things go to bigger, dumber, and more hilarious places.

It’s a funny concept to be sure. And, while Dig Your Own Grave borders on sketch, Larsen’s film manages to keep the momentum going past the reveal of the initial joke—a joke that, admittedly, makes me giggle every time I think of it. It’s anchored by two strong, well-timed performances (Amos Vernon and Henry Zebrowski have great awkward chemistry), Moreover, as silly as the idea is, it’s grounded by a sense of reality that keeps things from being too broadly unbelievable. It’s a fine line that all comedy shorts have to walk and Larsen and co-writer Vernon tip-toe it gracefully. Endings are hard (especially in comedies and horror shorts) and this doesn’t quite nail it, but the ride is entertaining enough to make it well worth the time that must be invested to watch. It’s somewhat facil analysis, I realize, but landing jokes is actually quite difficult and there are far more hits than misses here.

In discussing his inspiration, Larsen tells Short of the Week: “I wanted to honor my love for Scorsese, DePalma, and Hitchcock, while simultaneously loving the harmonic stupidity of putting two hilarious people together, like Step Brothers — or the funniest of Tarantino and Fincher’s work.”

I think that’s a succinct way of elucidating why Dig Your Own Grave is successful: in order to play dumb, underneath it all, you actually have to be really smart.

Larsen shot in the desert outside Los Angeles for a tumultuous two days with a hardworking cast and crew, led by DP Alex Chinnici. In post, he received finishing funds from the Hexagon Initiative (which features lots of S/W alum as members) to bring the film over the finish line.

As a writer/director, Larsen adroitly balances both technical craft and a sense of humor, the latter of which is noticeably absent in many “very serious” writer/directors making their way up in the industry. It’s this combination that makes him someone to watch. He’s currently working on a feature adaptation of Dig Your Own Grave, as well as other feature, television, and interactive projects.' - S/W Curator Ivan Kander

This is a story that is special because I think it is important to continue the conversation about the effects of bullying and how we should embrace or unique differences because a colorful world is a beautiful one. I also wanted to pay homage to silent films of the past and create a modern style silent film. This is why I wrote this story and wanted it to represent as my thesis film. 

Summary:
This is the story about a deaf girl who has been bullied to the point where she is completely broken and decides to try to end her life. A student worker sees her and must now try to save her life.


Thanks to everyone who has worked hard to help me pull my vision together. Without them, this would have not been possible.

Wajood (Selfhood) revolves around a young hijra's (trans-woman) life, who seems to fancy an auto-rickshaw driver.

DOORBELL - a short film | SHOR Films,_Sr11Bwsrs0,Short Movie,7.98,31270,384,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sr11Bwsrs0,"""Doorbell"" is a short film based on domestic violence produced by SHOR films, sadly domestic violence in Pakistan can be seen from 30 to 50% of the whole population and it gets worst when it starts to travel into our generations. The film portrays what's wrong and what would come back to us. Doorbell was produced in December 2019 by SHOR Films in Islamabad, Pakistan.

Behind the scenes story of Doorbell:

We really wanted a break!

All of us were really busy in studies, Fahad Qaseem Shorwala was dealing with his last semester at GIKI, I was building a news company in the evenings and early morning. Sheraz was doing his MBBS, Ali was becoming an engineer but was always looking for a place to showcase his filmmaking skills. We were already managing some corporate video production clients alongside but that creative keera was not satisfied. 

We got a chance!
An organisation rolled out a project to make something related to domestic violence and BOOM, we had an idea to try out all the extraordinary things we hadn't done yet. One of our Lawyer friend Shehrbano Awan had a script written which she really wanted to get filmed. We took that in and called the whole team to work!

We were shooting this video on a cinema camera, because we hadn't done that before, and that was just to satisfy our filmmaker kink. Everyone of the squad was put to word, Sara took the spot for Locations, Sheraz told us not to worry about money because ""Paiha baot ae"". Ali was an angel, he took care of literally everything related to script, costumes makeup etc. Asim bhai supported in everything and Shehram bhai came in for acting. Mustafa Bin Javed, Sheharyar Bhatti, Furqan Gul, Faiqa Akmal, Hassan Tariq, all were there sincerely investing their time for making this possible in the short span of only Two days!

Ok, last part of the story, Pakka!
We edited the video, aur hamain pasand nai aai, we edited again, aur hamain pasand nai aai, we made a music score aur hamain pasand nahi aaya, and...... Hamari hard drive kharab ho gai and we lost all the rawdata. Here you have something to watch, which is definitely not a 100%, But it is worth your time. Team ki efforts ka bharpoor izhar nazar aaye ga aap ko, which a hooking story! 
Khush rahain Khush rakhain 😃💯❤️
