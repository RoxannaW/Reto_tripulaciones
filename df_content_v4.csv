Real Time Desk Exercises &amp; Stretches - Ask Doctor Jo,CAq9vV7gkrs,Workout,11.12,14449,230,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAq9vV7gkrs,"These desk exercises and stretches are easy to do at your desk. Following along with this 10-minute, real-time routine should help keep your muscles and joints moving throughout the day. See Doctor Jo’s blog post about this at: http://www.askdoctorjo.com/desk-exercises-stretches-real-time

To start off, work your whole body and large muscles by doing a simple sit to stand movement. Put your feet about shoulder width apart, and stand up and sit down five times. Now while sitting, do a rotation stretch of the upper body to loosen up your spine. Turn one direction in your chair, and grab the back if you want a little more of a stretch. Hold these for about five seconds on each side. Do three on each side.

Next, you will stretch your forearm muscles. If you are typing a lot through out the day, these will hopefully feel really good. Start off with your arm straight out in front of you. Bring your wrists downward or into flexion. If you need more of a stretch, push down with the other hand. Hold for about five seconds and alternate sides. Now bring your wrists upward to stretch the opposite side.

The next exercises will be seated hip flexion. If you can roll your chair out from under your desk so you don’t hit your knees on the desk. Bring your knee upwards, and slowly come back down. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. Then you will kick your leg out to work your quad muscles. Kick your leg out until your knee is straight, and then pull your toes up towards you for a stretch. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. 

Now you will stretch your buttocks muscles that you are sitting on all day long. Take the leg of the side you want to stretch, and cross it over the other leg just above the knee. This will look like a figure 4 if you are looking down at your legs. You might feel the stretch already, but if you don’t, keeping your back straight, bend forward at your hips. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, and repeat 3 times.

Finally, stretch and exercise your calf muscles to help prevent DVTs. With your feet on the ground, alternate lifting your toes, and then lift your heels. Do ten of these.

Standing Desk Workout - 5 Exercises to do at Work,9N6ZQz-CV44,Workout,5.23,22612,313,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N6ZQz-CV44,"5 Exercises to do at a Stand-Up Desk, benefits of standing up more plus stand-up desk converter recommendations. 
Benefits = More energy, Better productivity, Less body stiffness, Stronger core and glutes, Flexible spine (less back pain).

If you're at work and you start to feel your energy drop and you're thinking about that third cup of coffee or a sugary snack to keep you going,  you might want to get your body moving instead. Not only does standing up for some of your day give you a more sustainable energy boost than an energy drink, but it also helps your body feel less tight and stiff. If you find yourself sitting down most of your day at work, you might want to get yourself a stand-up desk option or get up and do these moves every hour or half hour. 

If you are standing up at work already then here are 5 moves for you to strengthen your core and glutes, help your posture, loosen up a stiff neck and spine, plus get more focussed and productive while you work.

INTENSE Exercises To Do At Your Desk,DgxuAKSa6OM,Workout,10.52,155046,3356,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgxuAKSa6OM,"Hello Fitness Family! 

Back again with a workout video for you but this time, as you can see, I come to work with you! Really wanted to give those of you who have such busy schedules some options, so I conjured up some exercises into a nice little grouping you can do right at work, at your desk! I warn you (both men and women) that some of these exercises can generate some sweat so make sure you have your anti-perspirant handy and a clean undershirt (guys) and for women a shirt to change into, just incase! Please make sure you keep your BACK STRAIGHT, CORE TIGHT, CONCENTRATING and BREATHING NICE AND STEADY throughout the exercise grouping! 

""THE CUBICLE WORKOUT"" 
-- 5 EXERCISES GROUPED TOGETHER TO STIMULATE YOUR UPPER BODIES MOST IMPORTANT MUSCLES-- 
BEGINNERS: 5-10 SEC HOLDS, 2-3 SETS EACH 
ADVANCED: 15-20 SEC HOLDS, 4-5 SETS EACH

1ST EXERCISE -- PUSHES -- Sitting down, keep back straight, elbows out, hands open with palms out as if you are about to clap. Then put your hands flat together and push against each hand AS HARD AS YOU CAN -- This works your CHEST, BICEPS, TRICEPS, CORE, LATS -- Repeat according to your fitness level.

2ND EXERCISE -- PULLS -- Sitting down, keep back straight, elbows out, hands (fingers) interlocked with each other with palms out, then pull each hand AS HARD AS YOU CAN -- This works your LATS, BICEPS, FOREARMS, UPPER BACK, TRICEPS, CORE -- Repeat according to your fitness level.

3RD EXERCISE -- PUSHES W/ TOP/BOTTOM OF FISTS -- Sitting down, keep back straight, elbows out, make a fist with your hand like you are going to give yourself a pound, then push up with your bottom fist and push down with your top fist at the same time AS HARD AS YOU CAN -- This works your TRICEPS, BICEPS, FOREARMS, UPPER BACK, CHEST, CORE -- Repeat according to your fitness level.

4TH -- EXTENDED ARM PRESSES (LOW & HIGH) -- Sitting down, keeping your back straight, extend your arms out, open your palms and put your hands together like you are going to dive into a pool, but point your arms downward rather than straight out. Press your hands together while keeping your arms straight AS HARD AS YOU CAN (Do the exact same thing for the high presses) -- This works your CHEST, BICEPS, TRICEPS, SHOULDERS, LATS, UPPER BACK, FOREARMS, CORE -- Repeat according to your fitness level.

5TH EXERCISE -- UPRIGHT AIR CLAPS  -- Sitting down, keep back straight, arms in a 90 degree angle parallel to your body, then while keeping the best form you can, pretend like you want to clap as ahrd as you can without hitting your hands for 30 SECONDS AS FAST (and steady) AS YOU CAN -- This works your SHOULDERS, CORE, ARMS, BASICALLY YOUR WHOLE UPPER BODY -- THIS EXERCISE IS 30 SECONDS FOR BEGINNERS. IF YOU ARE ADVANCED DO 1 MINUTE.

Hope you guys who work those office jobs enjoy this! Had a great time making the video and big thank you to my missing puzzle piece Carli for being an amazing inspiration to me...I LOVE YOU.

10 Min Office Workout Exercises - Quick Office Workout Routine - How to Workout in Your Office

How to use my workout channel the most efficient way:

Pick what type of look you want to achieve with your training and how you like to train.

You have the following options:

1. I want to lose weight or I have never trained before. I am of a bigger size or I am of small/normal size, but I am too weak or don't have the skills to do workouts. IF THIS IS YOU... then you should do my 4 month weight loss program. This plan teaches you slowly to move your body everyday. Progressing each week so that you can end up with more energy and strength to be able to perform my harder programs. And to get the best results, please do the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 4 month weight loss program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbf0Vo4UlTo&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5ymDN3SdKOvNuJj9xw-n5YE 

2. I want a slim toned type of body and I like doing light toning exercises. I really don't want to build any muscle on my body, but I still want a feminine curvy shape. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT... then you should do my 3 month model program. This plan is based on toning up your whole body and fat burn without building visible muscle. And to get the best results, please follow the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 3 month model program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvJvaYKYvvs&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5x_834mP_tCWxA_DDfyO5fN

3. I want a curvy athletic shape with steel abs and a hard ass lol! If you want more visible muscle and possibly a Sixpack, then this is the plan for you. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.... then you should do my 3 month power program. You will build your glutes, six pack and strong arms. To get the the best results, please follow the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 3 month power program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CatXFOgOjDI&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5xQW-6WSemh-5wCc9JqvbKQ

4. I want to get in shape for bikini season and FAST! I want a firmer bum, a flatter stomach and flashy toned arms. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.... then you should do my 8 weeks bikini body guide. To get the the best results, please follow the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 8 week bikini guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WOV7x4eOCQ&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5y135e-4MpXVKdIjZOzM_Jc

5. I just want to start training, get in better shape, but I'm too busy! IF THIS IS YOU... then you should do my 30 days challenge. It's a great way to get in shape without putting too much time on it. You'll train 10-30minutes maximum per day. To get the the best results, please follow my model meal guide together with this plan.

Here is the 30 days challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VEW3cA0054&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5yqAa9BTKSDJaWy8Ch8JXxA

As for the meal guides. They are all based around 1500-1600 calories. The only difference is the way of eating, measuring food and how many times a day you'll eat. I recommend you to go through each meal guide and pick one that would suit your type of eating pattern and lifestyle best. You can use one meal guide from another program if that suits your life better.","['1 workout a day', 'fitness blender', 'blogilates', 'fitness', 'office workout exercises', 'office workout for women', 'office workout routine', 'office workout for men', 'office workout videos', 'office workout abs', 'office workout to loose weight', '10 min office workout', '10 minute office workout']",0.0

Please remember that we cannot spot reduce fat, meaning we can’t choose the areas on our body where we loose fat. However to get fat loss results I recommend the following
1. Being in calorie deficit
2. Cardio/ HIIT workout (I often call these Fat Loss/Burn workouts on my channel)
3. Specific muscle targeted workouts. To strengthen and develop specific muscles.
The key to achieving your fitness and health goals is consistency and healthy lifestyle changes, without restriction. I don’t believe in crazy fad diets. Simply eat nutritious food, move your body, smile and enjoy the journey!

5 MIN DAILY STRETCH - a super quick routine for every day / No Equipment I Pamela Reif,KPG1tJW8dwQ,Workout,6.23,1573779,32056,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPG1tJW8dwQ,"works perfectly as a cool down after ANY kind of workout, before bed or in the morning after waking up! ♥︎/ Werbung 

To be honest: I don't stretch enough. At the moment I just have 1 or 2 (that's optimistic) relaxed stretching sessions per week. 
With this cool down routine, I might change my habits though :D We all have 5min after a workout. And 5min (= 10 exercises) already go a long way. 
We stretch the sides of our body, our legs, tummy and work on our spine and hip mobility. No new or fancy exercises - but finally a super quick video we can stick to :D 

Let's calm down & give our bodies some love in a different kind of way. 
PS: I also have longer Stretching Routines on my channel ♥︎ 15min Daily Stretch & 2x 30min Stretching

5-Minute Warm Up for At-Home Workouts,Ks-lKvKQ8f4,Workout,5.92,5746074,60314,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-lKvKQ8f4,"Get access to more workouts by becoming a Patreon member: https://www.patreon.com/nicolepearce

Before any workout—and especially a high intensity one!—it's important to prepare your body. Depending on the type of workout you're about to do and any muscle imbalances or recovering injuries you have, a proper warm up will vary. In general though, you want to include some light-to-moderate cardio to gradually increase the heart rate and some dynamic (active) stretches for joint mobility.

This 5-minute warm up is made with the at-home workouts I post to my blog in mind. We'll start with two minutes of cardio bodyweight exercises and then move onto active stretches for a functional range of motion.

For more information on warm ups and workout ideas to do afterwards, check out my blog: http://pumpsandiron.com/2016/09/27/5-min-warm-up-for-at-home-workouts/

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GENTLER WARM UP, I have a toned down version of this video. No jumping during the cardio and a slower allover pace: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNJfhtfTJKY&feature=youtu.be

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY: 
- #1. Unlike other ab exercises, this one doesn't isolate abdominal muscles. Instead, standing knee raises train your upper and lower abs along with your hip, shoulder, and back muscles. Plus, this exercise doesn't strain your neck and lower back.
- #2. Floating knee tucks work your upper and lower abs to define and sculpt them. This exercise also makes your whole core stronger. It develops overall mobility and muscle endurance.
- #3. Roll-up lifts are perfect for your abdominal muscles. Besides, they help make your core stronger and increase your flexibility.
- #4. Not only does this exercise sculpt your abs, you’ll also see a more defined tush!
- #5. This exercise works your upper and lower abdominal muscles as well as your obliques. And that’s a great muscle group to target if you’re dealing with that all-so annoying muffin top. Bicycle crunches also train your quads, hamstrings, hips, and chest muscles.
- #6. Flutter kicks work magic on your lower abs and obliques. You also train your hip flexors and thigh muscles. Just be careful, and don’t do the fluttering motion too fast.
- #7. Oblique twist crunches are perfect for strengthening and defining the abs and waist. The exercise involves both the internal and external obliques, which means that not only your abs but also your core becomes stronger. As a result, it can help protect your spine and back muscles from injuries.
- #8. Twisting side plank is an effective way to tone your waist. And that’s because it targets the abs and obliques. It also strengthens the muscles of your core overall.

If you're in need of a five-minute full body stretch, then this video is for you!  This routine has 14 stretches, held for 20 second each, that will loosen your major muscle groups from head to toe.

One of the secrets of success with flexibility is having a routine. It doesn’t need to be long or complicated, either. Doing just a few minutes of basic stretches on most days of the week will help prevent the loss of flexibility while keeping your body performing optimally. 

A few quick pointers:
1. Studies show that a great time to stretch is after a cardio workout, when your muscles are warm from the increased blood flow.
2. You should feel a gentle stretch, not pain.
3. Remember to breathe throughout the stretch

5 MIN LOWER BODY WORKOUT (NO REST TABATA) // No Equipment &amp; Fat Burning | 5분 하체지방 폭파 타바타 운동,JIQUbPqfVV4,Workout,5.37,800898,16182,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIQUbPqfVV4,"Happy New Year. This is Louis from Allblanc TV.
Today's workout is 5 minute lower body tabata without ""rest"" !!
It is basically home-training routine (no equipment needed) so you can do everywhere, at home or gym.
Since it is more intense than normal one, you would feel stronger after finishing it.

What is your goal of 2020? What do you want to achieve this year?
For me, I decide to make stronger and healthier body in my life and give more motivation to you guys.
Therefore, I am preparing videos about more details of the workout routines. I hope all of you get motivated and follow and use them :)

Our 2020 just started !! Let's go to workout with me.
Thank you all

안녕하세요, 여러분. 올블랑 루이스입니다.  
오늘의 운동은 ""휴식없는"" 5분 하체운동 타바타입니다.
기본적으로 덤벨이나 도구가 필요없어 어디서든 운동하실 수 있게 홈트레이닝 루틴으로 만들었습니다! 
저희의 다른 타바타 운동보다 휴식시간이 없어 좀 더 강도가 높을테지만 그만큼 더 강해진다는 느낌을 받으실 꺼예요:)

여러분들의 2020년 목표는 무엇인가요? 올해는 무엇을 꼭 성취하고 싶으신가요?
저는 올해 제 인생에서 더 건강하고 강한 몸을 만들어보려고 합니다. 또한 여러분들에게도 많은 동기부여를 드리고 싶어요.
그래서 제 운동 루틴을 좀 더 상세하게 소개하는 영상들을 준비하고 있습니다. 앞으로 올라올 영상들을 통해서 여러분들이 더 많이 동기부여 받으시고 쉽게 활용하시기를 바랄께요^^

그럼, 희망차게 운동하러 가볼까요!?

Official Anabolic Aliens video of: Intense 5 Minute At Home Abs & Obliques Workout.

Give this intense 5 minute at home abs and obliques workout a try! You get a full abdominal and oblique workout without having to leave your house. Also, this works as a killer circuit to do at the gym more toward the end of your weighted abs & obliques workout since it's bodyweight only. Routines like this are great for those who travel and want to get a workout in too! No weights are needed. Your abs and obliques will be feeling it the next day due to how effective this circuit is. Use proper frequency and results will be maximized. Build those abs and get that six pack! 10 exercises, 30 seconds long each. Follow along with the video if you'd like, a timer is run throughout on the screen!

I trained more than 3x a week for 97% of 2019! That means I managed to workout regularly during 49 out of the 52 weeks that 2019 had to offer. 
That was only possible with my ""No Equipment"" workouts - otherwise I wouldn't have managed to be so consistent while traveling. When I'm home, I enjoy going to the gym & do some weight lifting as well :) but whenever I don't have time for that, I literally do sports with myself on YouTube.  I usually combine several videos, to have a 45-60min workout. 

__

This is a 10 minute Full Body Workout. I really ENJOY doing this one. I sometimes lose my balance when doing the ""Sprinters"" in the beginning - but that gets better over time! 

No Equipment necessary, no breaks (you're used to it by now I guess) and not much space needed :) If you need a break - take it! But make sure to join me again ♥︎

The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing. 30s for each exercise. 

I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your muscles in another way: check out my 10min Ab Workout, 20min Booty Workout or the Cooldown Routine to end your workout!

10 MIN HIGH INTENSITY WORKOUT - burn lots of calories / No Equipment I Pamela Reif,zr08J6wB53Y,Workout,10.77,2794873,52008,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr08J6wB53Y,".. ready for a KILLER routine? on a positive note: it's only 10 minutes & the music is amazing! ♥︎ / Werbung

I know, we have a love-hate relationship to my 15min HIIT workout. Me too, I admit that. 
A 10min routine was definitely missing on my channel! Still a killer, still burning lots of calories, still breaking a sweat.. but: it's only 10 minutes :D 

This workout is:
1. FILLED WITH BASICS. 
Nothing too fancy, nothing too dancy. Ask your male partner to join! They won't need to shake their hips for this one.
2. a mix out of ""QUICK MOVEMENTS"" and ""ACTIVE BREAKS"".  
You will find Dolphin Holds & Planks in between all the quick movements. Almost feels like a break, but don't forget to keep the core strength :D
3. HIGH ENERGY. 
For some reason it doesn't drag me down - but rather gives me MORE energy! Might also be the music though.

by the way: NO LUNGES. 

__

If you struggle or need a break: don't worry about it. Take a small rest, get something to drink & continue once you're ready :) most important is that you don't quit and push yourself. 

▸ Depending on your fitness level, height and weight you will burn between 70-130 kcal. 
I burned about 80kcal in those 10min (which is a lot for me, I'm a small human and I normally burn about 250kcal in a 1h session).

Whenever I meet people who workout with my videos & ask them which one they like most they ALWAYS say: ""your Sixpack Workout!"". 
After 1.5 years it might be time for a new one then haha! 

MY OPINION: burns even more, makes me sweat more and gives me such a good feeling in my abs! Maybe it's also because I'm not as ""used"" to this exercise combination yet. In any way: you should definitely give it a try :) 

▸ Would love to hear which one you prefer - the old or the new one?

If you have a hard time keeping up with my super intense ""10min Ab Workout"" and ""10min Sixpack Workout""... THIS ONE IS FOR YOU :) 

Everybody starts somewhere and my other workouts require suuuper strong core muscles. That's why I really wanted to create an ab workout, that is suitable for beginners - while still being super effective. 

And listen.. it even includes BREAKS! :D 
(If you feel like it's too easy with the breaks though: just continue the last exercise during the break & jump into the new movement one once I start with it as well)

My mom tried this workout and said, that it's 100% manageable for her .. although she usually isn't so much into working out. That means: no excuses for you. GIVE IT A TRY ♥︎

10 MIN CALORIE KILLER / Medium Level - a HIIT workout that won&#39;t kill you I Pamela Reif,NmCXy7oMsOs,Workout,10.53,2879020,47826,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCXy7oMsOs,"This workout kills calories, but it won't kill YOU! ♥︎ / Anzeige

Yes, that's right. I created a routine that won't make you gasping for air, calling me bad names & question your life haha. 
This routine includes pretty basic movements and always switches between ""getting your heart rate up"" and static holds as an ""active rest"". 

I hope you enjoy this one (and the view in Ibiza)!! ♥︎

▸ calories burned are between 70-110kcal, depending on your weight, height & fitness level!  I'm a short and tiny person & I burned 70kcal :) 

__

The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. If you need a break - TAKE IT! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! I also recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. 

▸ you can find WORKOUT PLANS with those videos on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations. Check out the Highlight Bubble ""Workout Plans"" for that.

10-Minute Workout to Sculpt Your Body in 2 Weeks,2DNioliqOug,Workout,14.62,8694453,228759,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DNioliqOug,"How to burn fat quickly?

SUMMARY
-Take the plank position, but make sure you are standing on your elbows. You can start from 10 seconds and gradually increase it all the way up to 30 seconds.
-Take the elbow plank position again, but this time with your palms on the floor. For the first 10 seconds lift your left leg as we are showing.
-Now you need only one elbow. Hold yourself on it, while the other hand is at your waist. Your legs should be on top of each other.
-Go from the elbow plank position to the regular plank position and back. You should do this one arm at a time.
-When squatting, make sure your feet don’t move, and your hands are straight! We recommend doing at least 20 squats, but it depends on you.
-Now you need to do 15 lunges. They should be pretty low, with your knee almost touching the floor.
-Lie on the floor with your knees up. Your arms should be on floor — you will use them to keep the balance. Lift your butt 20 times.
-Take weights and stretch your arms like you see in the video. Now make circles with your arms. We recommend 40 reps.
-The punches don’t have to be very fast and strong. Be as relaxed as you can. Do it 40 times.
-You should do 20 push-ups on your knees with your feet crossed. Keep your back straight while doing the exercise.
-Lift your right knee up and put it down. Right after that, put both your hands up and put them down.
-Take the full plank position again. Bend your right knee 20 times and then repeat it with your right knee.
-Take the full plank position again. Then you need to switch to the I-am-about-to-jump-up position with your hands touching the ground, then, jump up.

10 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT (NO EQUIPMENT BODYWEIGHT WORKOUT!),rAU7taj1g6E,Workout,10.48,248766,6498,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAU7taj1g6E,"If you wish to grow you Abs and develop a nice looking mid section, you MUST train them directly. I can not stress this enough: no matter how much you can dead lift, squat or bench press, your abs will simply never pop if you can't perform a strict, controlled leg raise. So, if you're after a nice set of abs, please understand that training them directly is an absolute essential piece to the puzzle. However, when it's all said and done, if you're not incorporating the necessary nutritional protocols, then they will simply never shine through.

Control is also crucial when training your Abs. Understand that if you can't see you Abs, it's either cause your body fat is too high or your Abs simply aren't developed enough for them to shine through. And sure you could pin this to 'genetics', but that would most be a bunch of BS. The truth is that abs are very easy to neglect... even though it's one of the most desired and aesthetically pleasing muscle groups. There’s simply no way around it - and if you’re wanting to develop solid six pack, you’ll want to make sure you’re building in the gym & revealing them in kitchen.

This video is full length which means you can just follow along with whatever I'm doing. If you need extra rest, just pause the video. If you don't need a rest - watch it the whole way through.

You can hit this home workout 2-3x per week - and if you wanted to keep active on your other days - be sure to check out my other workouts!

Real Time Desk Exercises &amp; Stretches - Ask Doctor Jo,CAq9vV7gkrs,Stretch,11.12,14449,230,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAq9vV7gkrs,"These desk exercises and stretches are easy to do at your desk. Following along with this 10-minute, real-time routine should help keep your muscles and joints moving throughout the day. See Doctor Jo’s blog post about this at: http://www.askdoctorjo.com/desk-exercises-stretches-real-time

To start off, work your whole body and large muscles by doing a simple sit to stand movement. Put your feet about shoulder width apart, and stand up and sit down five times. Now while sitting, do a rotation stretch of the upper body to loosen up your spine. Turn one direction in your chair, and grab the back if you want a little more of a stretch. Hold these for about five seconds on each side. Do three on each side.

Next, you will stretch your forearm muscles. If you are typing a lot through out the day, these will hopefully feel really good. Start off with your arm straight out in front of you. Bring your wrists downward or into flexion. If you need more of a stretch, push down with the other hand. Hold for about five seconds and alternate sides. Now bring your wrists upward to stretch the opposite side.

The next exercises will be seated hip flexion. If you can roll your chair out from under your desk so you don’t hit your knees on the desk. Bring your knee upwards, and slowly come back down. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. Then you will kick your leg out to work your quad muscles. Kick your leg out until your knee is straight, and then pull your toes up towards you for a stretch. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. 

Now you will stretch your buttocks muscles that you are sitting on all day long. Take the leg of the side you want to stretch, and cross it over the other leg just above the knee. This will look like a figure 4 if you are looking down at your legs. You might feel the stretch already, but if you don’t, keeping your back straight, bend forward at your hips. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, and repeat 3 times.

Finally, stretch and exercise your calf muscles to help prevent DVTs. With your feet on the ground, alternate lifting your toes, and then lift your heels. Do ten of these.

These neck and shoulder stretches form an ideal stretching routine for a quick work or study break at your desk. Hope you enjoy!

Neck Exercises Demonstrated in Video
1. Shoulder Rolls - to release tension in upper shoulder and neck muscles coordinated with breathing to release muscle tension
2. Ear to shoulder stretch - feel the stretch in the side of the neck and shoulder. This stretches the side of neck and upper shoulder away from the direction of head movement.
3. Nose towards thigh stretch - stretches the side and back of neck into the shoulder blade on the side of the neck away from the direction of head movement. This action stretches the upper trapezius and levator scapula muscles as well as opening the facet joints in the neck.
4. Head forward tilt stretch - taking nose forwards stretches back of neck and upper back muscles.
5. Neck rotation stretch - turning head and looking over shoulder stretches upper shoulder and side of neck muscles. The addition of over pressure can help increase neck rotation movement.
6. Arc of movement taking chin to chest from one shoulder to the other - stretches the neck and upper shoulder muscles and opens facet joints in the neck.

Always avoid overstretching and keep your breathing relaxed when stretching for maximum benefit. All neck pain stretches should feel comfortable during and after stretching. Cease any exercise that causes discomfort during or after stretching.","['neck pain', 'physical therapy', 'neck stretches', 'shoulder stretches', 'neck exercises', 'Michelle Kenway', 'Physiotherapy', 'neck pain relief']",1.193975895396662

Hi! I'm Christina, and welcome to my yoga YouTube channel, ChriskaYoga! This is a 10 minute yoga sequence that you can do during work right in your office chair. You can actually do this in any kind of chair, and it's a great way to destress and unwind during your work day. 

We'll begin the sequence by sitting up tall in your chair with your back up straight and feet planted on the ground. After a brief guided meditation, we'll come into some neck and shoulder stretches to release tension. 

We will then take a forward fold in our chair to release out your low back. To stretch out your whole body, we're going to stand up from the chair (if you would like to) and reach all the way up looking towards your hands (utthita hastasana in tadasana), and we'll also take a slight arch looking up and opening our chest. 

Once done, we'll sit back down and stretch our arms, and then we will come into a modified seated pigeon pose alternative stretching the glutes, thighs, and hips. After this, we will take a seated twist and side bend on both sides, and then take another short meditation sitting up tall in the chair.

WHY DO I GET NECK AND BACK PAIN AT WORK?

Think about it - when you get to work in the morning you probably sit down in your chair and then don’t get up until lunchtime. Then you sit back down and don’t stand up again until it’s time to go home.

As humans, we simply weren’t designed to sit for that amount of time! Add the fact that most of us don’t sit in a workstation that fits us the right way and it’s no wonder we experience neck and back pain at work.

FIRST STEP - SET UP YOUR WORKSPACE

The first (and most important) thing you need to do is set up your workstation in a way that is right for your body. This is the fastest way to decrease stress on your muscles and joints and help you out of the pain you might be experiencing. To learn how to do this, please watch this helpful video: https://youtu.be/x12GnuV9Qgw

5 GREAT STRETCHES YOU CAN DO AT WORK

Today I wanted to share with you some simple stretches and exercises you can do right at your desk to eliminate neck and back pain. These exercises take about 5-6 minutes to complete and can be done every hour while you’re seated at your computer.

1. Chin Tucks - Great way to eliminate tension headaches and get your head back in a proper alignment over your neck.

2. Scapula Retraction or “Pinches” - One of the best exercises to eliminate tension in your neck and upper back.

3. Upper Trapezius Stretch - One of the most-common places to get muscle knots is in your upper neck and shoulders. These stretches are an effective way to treat pain in those areas.

4. Anterior/Posterior Pelvic Tilts - Mobilize your back by taking it through flexion and extension ranges of motion.

5. Seated Marches - Promotes blood flow into your hips and alleviates pressure off of your hamstrings while marching at your desk.

Back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal conditions among office workers. You might be fortunate enough to use a sit to stand desk, but working for several hours can still cause problems. 

Whether you’re sitting or standing, the muscles in your back and legs can become tight causing increased strain in your joints. Using a standing mat and taking breaks will help, but stretching is a more direct way to address these symptoms. Stretching exercises can improve your back pain and increase your flexibility. 

In this video, Taylor shows you twelve excellent stretches that you can do in standing, sitting, or on the floor.

10 Minute Standing Stretches | Pilates at Your Desk,iz-IXKMF0G4,Stretch,10.18,6166,98,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz-IXKMF0G4,"If you sit at a desk all day, you body will thank you for taking 10 minutes to do some standing stretches and there is no better break than doing Pilates at Your Desk.

We are going to get up out of the chair and take a few minutes to move and stretch. 

I can almost guarantee that you will feel better after these standing Pilates inspired stretches and this video proves that we don’t need a long mat Pilates session to feel so much better. 

This is a Pilates class for the days when you don’t have much time and bonus, it can be done in your regular clothes. I do recommend a stable chair or surface for support.  

Even if you are beginning Pilates, these 10 minute Pilates stretches are easy to follow along.

You can do this Pilates class at home with no equipment or in the office.

Sitting kills. Multiple studies now support that sitting is the new smoking, with people who sit too long having a 54% increase in heart attack risk.

Even though most of us spend multiple hours on our desk chair every day averaging 9.3 hours of total sitting a day, there is light at the end of the tunnel: Taking frequent breaks at work, to get up and walk or stretch, breaks the vicious sitting cycle and reduces the brutal effects of sitting on our longevity.

That's why I have created the Office Exercise & Stretch app. I did it to help myself get up from my chair more often -- because I too sit for multiple hours a day! It's available on Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitnessreloaded.office_exercise_and_stretch_pro&hl=en) and Windows 8 (http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/office-exercise-stretch/7afa2033-1171-4f2c-8119-e1f11669cee5).

In today's episode I included 7 stretching exercises from my Office Exercise & Stretch app to do when you need to take a break and get some extra energy at work.","['office exercises', 'office stretch', 'office stretching', 'exercise at work', 'stretch at work']",0.6555208623901091
Physio Upper Back Stretch &amp; Relieve Desk Break Routine,TMDX7hdQKSY,Stretch,5.87,73417,1162,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMDX7hdQKSY,"Physical Therapist routine of upper back stretches to relieve pain and tension (at your desk) from http://www.pelvicexercises.com.au This quick desk stretching routine helps you release your shoulders & upper back muscle leaving your body feeling more comfortable and relaxed.

The upper back and shoulder stretches demonstrated in this video include:
- Shoulder rolls for shoulder release
- Reach forwards middle back stretch
- Reach behind chest and front of shoulder stretch
- Reach forwards and grasp under thighs for middle trapezius (middle back) stretch
- Back extension stretch to mobilize tight thoracic joints in the mid spine
- Arm across opposite shoulder stretch for rhomboids (mid back) and rotator cuff (back of shoulder) stretch
- Spinal rotation stretch opens facet joints of middle and lower back and stretches middle back and shoulder muscles

These upper back stretches and shoulder stretches are general stretches for releasing muscle tension and associated discomfort. The stretches should always feel comfortable. Cease any exercise that causes discomfort.

If you're in need of a five-minute full body stretch, then this video is for you!  This routine has 14 stretches, held for 20 second each, that will loosen your major muscle groups from head to toe.

One of the secrets of success with flexibility is having a routine. It doesn’t need to be long or complicated, either. Doing just a few minutes of basic stretches on most days of the week will help prevent the loss of flexibility while keeping your body performing optimally. 

A few quick pointers:
1. Studies show that a great time to stretch is after a cardio workout, when your muscles are warm from the increased blood flow.
2. You should feel a gentle stretch, not pain.
3. Remember to breathe throughout the stretch

Shoulder Stretch to Fix Your Shoulders (GET DEEP!),J9yRiOeVvIM,Stretch,6.83,3354166,61345,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9yRiOeVvIM,"Build bigger shoulders while keeping them healthy with A-X

Shoulder pain is one of the most common ailments that derail a good workout.  Most often, a few shoulder stretches are all that is needed to not just correct the issue but prevent it from occurring in the first place.  That said, not many know how to properly stretch their shoulder to help stop shoulder pain from killing their workouts.  In this video, I show you one of the most common shoulder maladies that causes discomfort when lifting and how to assess whether you are suffering from it so that you can fix it.

The shoulder joint is wrapped tightly by a fibrous structure called a capsule.  The shoulder capsule has a posterior portion that is responsible for providing integrity and support to the humerus within the ball and socket.  When the muscles surrounding the shoulder get tight (in particular the rotator cuff) those muscles have a tendency to push the head of the humerus forward in the shoulder joint.  Once there, the capsule can begin to adaptively shorten which leads to much more chronic and serious changes in the joint.

To prevent shoulder capsule shrinking and tightness, you must have a way to stretch this structure out.  First however, you need to determine whether or not the tightness you feel is from the capsule or from another muscle or muscles in and around the shoulder.

I show you a posterior capsule test that will help you to figure out what you are dealing with.  Lie on your back with your arm fully internally rotated.  Be sure that you are internally rotating the arm at the shoulder and not just pronating your forearm.  From there, hold your arm perpendicular to the ground at ninety degrees and make sure that your back doesn’t roll and your shoulder blade does not lose contact with the ground.  

Try to bring your arm across your chest.  If you can get the outside of your elbow to cross your chest midline then you likely don’t have a tight posterior capsule and instead are dealing with either a tight posterior delt or lat.  Stretches can be seen for those in future videos here on our channel.

The sleeper stretch as shown in this video is great for stretching out the posterior shoulder capsule and helping you to restore normal mobility within the shoulder joint.  Be sure not to crank on your arm too much during this stretch and aim to complete it a few times each week for 45-60 seconds each time until you get up to 70 degrees of internal rotation back to your shoulder and can almost touch the ground with the fingers on the affected side.

If you want a complete workout program that helps you to restore maximum mobility and flexibility to unlock your greatest strength and size gains ever, be sure to head to http://athleanx.com and get the ATHLEAN-X Training System.

Physio Neck Exercises Stretch &amp; Relieve Routine,yt3CpkmFAfc,Stretch,5.17,3755876,41288,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt3CpkmFAfc,"Physical Therapist neck exercises from https://www.pelvicexercises.com.au with Physio Michelle who guides you through this 5 minute exercise routine to stretch your neck muscles and relieve tension in your neck and shoulders.

Thank you!

Michelle Kenway presents a series of neck exercises that focus upon relieving commonly experienced areas of tension. The exercises presented are general neck exercises and should all feel comfortable and pain free. These exercises are not designed to treat specific neck conditions. Never stretch beyond the limits of personal comfort and immediately cease any neck exercises that are associated with any physical discomfort.

This exercise video guides you step by step through a number of basic neck exercises and techniques to relieve  neck and shoulder muscles and improve posture.

Neck exercise 1 - Correct sitting posture for neck stretches

Sit with your spine lengthened and tall by lifting the crown of your head towards the ceiling, raising your sternum slightly and relaxing your shoulders back and down.

Neck exercise 2 - Shoulder rolls

Shoulder rolls relieve tension in the neck and shoulders. This exercise involves circular movements of the shoulder girdle forwards, upwards, backwards and down as if drawing circles with the shoulders. This exercise can be coordinated with breathing, breathing in as you raise your shoulders upwards and exhaling as you roll your shoulders back and down. It can be useful to use this exercise as a technique to relax your neck and shoulders and to set your correct posture.

Neck exercise 3 - Chin to chest

Chin to chest stretch is directed towards stretching the muscles at the back of the neck. Sit tall with your spine lengthened and gently lower your chin towards your chest as you breathe out. Repeat slowly and gently 3-4 times in a row.

Neck exercise 4 - Ear to shoulder stretch

This neck exercise involves directing the ear towards the shoulder to stretch and relieve tension in the muscles at the side of the neck. First correct your posture, stabilise or fix your left shoulder down by taking your left hand to hold under your chair. Slowly lower your right ear to your right shoulder keeping your nose facing forwards throughout. This neck exercise stretches the neck muscles in the left side of your neck. The stretch may be felt anywhere from below the left ear, the left side of the neck and into the left upper shoulder. This stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. 

Neck exercise 5 - Nose to armpit stretch

Nose to armpit stretch is a useful stretch for relieving the muscles that run from the head into the shoulder. First correct your posture, stabilise your shoulder girdle by grasping under the seat of your chair with your left hand and rotate your head towards the right, lowering your nose to your right armpit. You will feel a gentle stretch on the left side of your neck. This stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. Perform this stretch on both sides of the neck.

Neck exercise 6 - Nose to opposite knee 

Nose to opposite knee can stretch and relieve the muscles that run through the back of the neck into the top of the shoulder blade (these muscles lift the shoulder blade). Set your posture and stabilise your left shoulder down by taking your left hand to hold under your chair. Rotate your head slightly to the right and gently lower your nose towards your right knee. Nose to opposite knee stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. Nose to opposite knee can be performed on both sides of the neck.

Upper back/shoulder exercise 7 - Forward reach

To stretch the muscles in your middle back between your shoulder blades, link your fingers together, roll your shoulders forwards and reach out in front of your body. Gently lower your chin to your chest to combine some additional neck stretch exercise.

Chest stretch exercise 8 - Backward reach

To stretch your chest and assist good posture, link your fingers together behind your back. Raise your arms away from your back and lift your chest at the same time. You should feel a gentle stretch across the front of your chest.

Reset your posture to finish

To complete your neck exercises, roll your shoulders in circles a couple of times, coordinate this action with your breathing and reset your posture with your spine straight and your shoulders relaxed and down.","['neck exercises', 'neck stretches', 'Physical Exercise (Word)', 'physical therapist', 'neck stretching exercises', 'neck exercise video', 'exercise video', 'Stretch', 'Stretching (Character Power)', 'Physical Therapy (Medical Specialty)', 'Neck Pain (Symptom)']",1.0992908179077265
7 MIN STRETCHING EXERCISES AFTER WORKOUT | FULL BODY COOL DOWN FOR RELAXATION &amp; FLEXIBILITY,FlAvRcz0zuY,Stretch,7.15,1204446,14691,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlAvRcz0zuY,"These 7 minute stretching exercises can be done at home ideally after every workout so that you can cool down your full body properly. These stretches are amazing for flexibility and relaxation after workouts. You can do them at night or in the morning!

Stretching after your workout is very important because you want to cool down your body and bring your heart rate down slowly after working hard. You only need a fast routine to help your muscles relax and recover. This is also great to avoid your body to get tense and increase flexibility. 

I like to do these stretching exercises in the morning, after a workout and at night before bed because they help me relax and practice my flexibility at the same time in only 7 minutes! If you have more time at home, feel free to keep going or hold the stretches for longer so that your full body gets into a deeper stretch!

Stretching makes the body more flexible, improves our emotional state, and reduces pain. Also, stretching is extremely important to do to reduce tension in the body!

SUMMARY:
- After a month of doing some simple stretching exercises, my back feels less stiff and my muscles have become more flexible. Now even after a long workday, I don’t feel any pain and the knots in my shoulder have disappeared.
- Shortly after I started following my stretching routine, I noticed that it took me less time to fall asleep and I felt much more refreshed in the morning. 
- Because the quality of my sleep was better, I also started to feel more energized throughout the day. Before, it was really difficult for me to stay awake during my long workday and after lunch.
- According to Japanese scientists, poor flexibility is connected with arterial stiffening that leads to high blood pressure. That means that stretching naturally lowers high blood pressure, reducing your level of bad cholesterol. 
- After a month of stretching, I’ve noticed that I have become way less clumsy. I don’t know, maybe it’s in my head, but I swear I have no more random bruises on my legs.
- Stretching has improved my posture, which takes extra stress away from my head, neck, and shoulder muscles. So whenever I feel a headache creeping up on me, I just start doing some exercises at my desk and it saves me from the pain. 
- Bending my body in different positions increases blood flow to the bowels, reducing inflammation and gastritis. After incorporating stretching into my daily routine, my bloating is gone and I just feel lighter. 
- Obviously, if you get rid of that tension, you’ll feel calmer. This is exactly what happened to me thanks to stretching. I have clarity of mind and I don’t waste time or energy anymore on annoying thoughts that make me feel anxious.

Stretching is KILLING Your Gains (BIG MISTAKE!),nLQefKzMVjo,Stretch,6.75,2344517,47589,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLQefKzMVjo,"Get jacked in 90 days here - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workouts

Stretching, when done the right way at the wrong time can absolutely be killing your gains.  The issue is that many people do not know the difference between active and static stretching and the impact that doing one over the other before your workout can be having on your strength and ultimately your size gains.  In this video, I’m going to show you why you should not do static stretching that you hold for any length of time before you train if you want to get maximum muscle growth and strength.

The issue boils down to neural efficiency.  When you perform any movement, it doesn’t matter if it is something you would define as an exercise, your body has a stored pattern for accomplishing it.  It does this in order to create movement efficiency.  If I drop a pen on the ground and I bend to pick it up, your body doesn’t have to think about every single joint component of motion that is needed to get you down to the ground.  Instead, it thinks of the “squat” movement in general and is able to instantly help you down to the floor without wasting any time.

When you perform static stretching of muscles that are going to be trained in your workout that day, you are negatively interfering with your stored engrams or motor patterns.  While increasing flexibility and the length of a muscle can be a very good thing long term, doing stretches just prior to your workout that temporarily do this can have this associated downside that winds up costing you gains from your workouts.

The length tension relationship between muscles is something that you have that is unique to you and different from one muscle to the next.  While not all length tension relationships are optimal, it is still what your body is used to and what is being used by it when calling on the stored motor pattern when performing a movement.  Static or passive stretching before a workout will temporarily disrupt these patterns by affecting the actin and myosin cross bridging.  

If you were going to use this method of warming up for a workout, you would then have to spend a significant amount of time prior to starting your training just to attempt to re-integrate the movements to better match up to the engrams stored for that movement pattern or exercise.  In this case, I would suggest doing two or three light sets of each of the exercises you were going to do in that workout after completing the static stretching routine. This could add at least a half an hour to your workout when you account for the stretching and the re-integration.

There is a better way.  You can instead opt to perform active or dynamic stretching for the muscles that are going to be involved in the exercises you are about to perform that day.  These are movement stretches that take your joints actively into new ranges without ever holding for any length of time.  The disruption to the muscles is greatly minimized and your ability to feel loose and perform at a high level is maintained.

That said, static stretching is still vital and has a place in your routine.  The best thing to do is do your stretches for the muscles that you worked that day, later on at night before you go to bed.  When you sleep, your body heals itself and the muscles that were trained tend to heal a bit shorter.  You can lessen this shortening effect by performing the static stretches just before laying down.  When you wake up the next morning you should not only feel more loose but you will likely have less muscle soreness as well.

How to Stretch Your Chest (AND HOW NOT TO!),SV7l1sfEmO0,Stretch,9.28,3006680,89778,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV7l1sfEmO0,"Build a ripped, muscular chest with this complete workout
http://athleanx.com/x/how-to-build-a-ripped-muscular-chest

Every chest workout should be balanced out with some chest stretching to be sure we don’t leave ourselves too tight.  When the pecs get tight (both pec major and pec minor) we wind up causing imbalances in our shoulder girdles that often lead to injuries down the road.  In this video, I show you how to stretch your chest so that you keep your pec muscles loose and less vulnerable to injury.

To begin with, the pec major is a fan shaped muscle that has two portions; the sternal and clavicular areas.  The sternal area of the pectoralis major runs from the sternum to a point on your humerus in your upper arm.  The role of this muscle is to horizontally adduct your arm as you complete a bench press or cable crossover movement.  The problem is, when this muscle is tight, we will also see an internal rotation at the shoulder that will develop.  This excessive internal rotation is enough to throw your shoulder joint into a position more likely to experience impingement. 

To stretch the pec major we have to be sure we retract our scapula and keep the head of the humerus positioned back in the shoulder joint.  We want to try and avoid stretching our pecs by holding onto the corner of a door frame and leaning through the door.  This can create an overload on the structures in the anterior shoulder capsule which can do damage over time.  Instead, you want to position yourself in a door frame with your humerus anchored and supported against the frame.  You want to lean forward just slightly and pinch your shoulder blades behind you.  Turn your head away and down to increase the pull on the clavicular fibers of the pec major.

To get the pec minor muscle on stretch you want to be sure you reverse the actions of the muscle.  The major actions of the pec minor are to tilt the scapula forward, rotate it downward and protract the shoulder blade forward.  Once again, you use the doorway to slide your arm up the jamb and aim for the exact opposite motions just listed.  This will help you to upwardly rotate the scapula and retract it while tipping it back towards vertical.

If you want to maintain injury free shoulders when lifting weights you are going to have to learn how to stretch your chest and pecs properly.  This video shows you two stretches that you can do for your pecs to make sure they stay loose and therefore prevents you from developing imbalances in your upper body.  Most of the show muscles like the chest, lats, and arms will act to internally rotate the shoulder and contribute to the problem.  If you can learn how to stretch your chest the right way however you can go a long way towards preventing this from happening.

10 Min Office Workout Exercises - Quick Office Workout Routine - How to Workout in Your Office

How to use my workout channel the most efficient way:

Pick what type of look you want to achieve with your training and how you like to train.

You have the following options:

1. I want to lose weight or I have never trained before. I am of a bigger size or I am of small/normal size, but I am too weak or don't have the skills to do workouts. IF THIS IS YOU... then you should do my 4 month weight loss program. This plan teaches you slowly to move your body everyday. Progressing each week so that you can end up with more energy and strength to be able to perform my harder programs. And to get the best results, please do the meal guide included in this plan.

Here is the 4 month weight loss program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbf0Vo4UlTo&list=PLXHCSxBsKR5ymDN3SdKOvNuJj9xw-n5YE 

2. I want a slim toned type of body and I like doing light toning exercises. I really don't want to build any muscle on my body, but I still want a feminine curvy shape.

5 MINUTES HOME OFFICE WORKOUT,NViky1wr7yQ,Workout,7.7,183,11,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NViky1wr7yQ,"During this difficult time, staying at home may increase the time spend in sedentary behaviour (low-energy activities). Prolonged time sitting, working intensely from your home or the office, might lead to stiffness, muscle imbalances and pain in many different areas of your body, such as lower and upper back, neck, shoulders, elbows and wrists. 

These exercises will help you keep active, stretching your muscles and all your joints, increase your blood flow and boosting concentration. They are designed and lead by our Clinical Exercise Physiologist, Dr. Alexsander Guimaraes.  

It's important give yourself five minutes break/movement every hour whilst sitting or working at your desk/computer to keep your body moving, allowing the blood flow and stretching your muscles.

Shoulder Pain Relief Stretches – 5 Minute Real Time Routine,6jHsraw2NIk,Workout,8.08,1168251,27489,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jHsraw2NIk,"These shoulder pain relief stretches are great for helping to relieve general shoulder pain and shoulder tightness. The shoulder stretches are done in real time, so they are easy to follow. Buy a worksheet with these shoulder stretches: https://www.askdoctorjo.com/7-shoulder-stretches-worksheet

In general when stretching the shoulders, you should hold most stretches for 30 seconds, and do them 3 times. Sometimes you might not have enough time to go through your whole routine, which can be time consuming. If you are in a hurry, still hold the shoulder stretches for 30 seconds, but do less reps.

A quick warm up will help warm up and loosen the shoulder muscles to help get them going.

A great way to stretch the shoulder is by stretching out the joint capsule. You can stretch the posterior capsule or a cross arm stretch, and you can stretch the inferior capsule with a triceps stretch.

Also, stretching some of your rotator cuff muscles, like the subscapularis may help relieve the shoulder pain. If going into external rotation of your shoulder is painful, you can modify this stretch.

Finally, a chest or pec stretch and an upper trap stretch will help the shoulder and neck areas.

Benefits = More energy, Better productivity, Less body stiffness, Stronger core and glutes, Flexible spine (less back pain).

If you're at work and you start to feel your energy drop and you're thinking about that third cup of coffee or a sugary snack to keep you going,  you might want to get your body moving instead. Not only does standing up for some of your day give you a more sustainable energy boost than an energy drink, but it also helps your body feel less tight and stiff. If you find yourself sitting down most of your day at work, you might want to get yourself a stand-up desk option or get up and do these moves every hour or half hour. 

If you are standing up at work already then here are 5 moves for you to strengthen your core and glutes, help your posture, loosen up a stiff neck and spine, plus get more focussed and productive while you work.

Physio Neck Exercises Stretch &amp; Relieve Routine,yt3CpkmFAfc,Workout,5.17,3755876,41288,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt3CpkmFAfc,"Physical Therapist neck exercises from https://www.pelvicexercises.com.au with Physio Michelle who guides you through this 5 minute exercise routine to stretch your neck muscles and relieve tension in your neck and shoulders.

Can you transcribe this video to a language other than English? 
http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&v=yt3CpkmFAfc
Thank you!

Michelle Kenway presents a series of neck exercises that focus upon relieving commonly experienced areas of tension. The exercises presented are general neck exercises and should all feel comfortable and pain free. These exercises are not designed to treat specific neck conditions. Never stretch beyond the limits of personal comfort and immediately cease any neck exercises that are associated with any physical discomfort.

This exercise video guides you step by step through a number of basic neck exercises and techniques to relieve  neck and shoulder muscles and improve posture.

Neck exercise 1 - Correct sitting posture for neck stretches

Sit with your spine lengthened and tall by lifting the crown of your head towards the ceiling, raising your sternum slightly and relaxing your shoulders back and down.

Neck exercise 2 - Shoulder rolls

Shoulder rolls relieve tension in the neck and shoulders. This exercise involves circular movements of the shoulder girdle forwards, upwards, backwards and down as if drawing circles with the shoulders. This exercise can be coordinated with breathing, breathing in as you raise your shoulders upwards and exhaling as you roll your shoulders back and down. It can be useful to use this exercise as a technique to relax your neck and shoulders and to set your correct posture.

Neck exercise 3 - Chin to chest

Chin to chest stretch is directed towards stretching the muscles at the back of the neck. Sit tall with your spine lengthened and gently lower your chin towards your chest as you breathe out. Repeat slowly and gently 3-4 times in a row.

Neck exercise 4 - Ear to shoulder stretch

This neck exercise involves directing the ear towards the shoulder to stretch and relieve tension in the muscles at the side of the neck. First correct your posture, stabilise or fix your left shoulder down by taking your left hand to hold under your chair. Slowly lower your right ear to your right shoulder keeping your nose facing forwards throughout. This neck exercise stretches the neck muscles in the left side of your neck. The stretch may be felt anywhere from below the left ear, the left side of the neck and into the left upper shoulder. This stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. 

Neck exercise 5 - Nose to armpit stretch

Nose to armpit stretch is a useful stretch for relieving the muscles that run from the head into the shoulder. First correct your posture, stabilise your shoulder girdle by grasping under the seat of your chair with your left hand and rotate your head towards the right, lowering your nose to your right armpit. You will feel a gentle stretch on the left side of your neck. This stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. Perform this stretch on both sides of the neck.

Neck exercise 6 - Nose to opposite knee 

Nose to opposite knee can stretch and relieve the muscles that run through the back of the neck into the top of the shoulder blade (these muscles lift the shoulder blade). Set your posture and stabilise your left shoulder down by taking your left hand to hold under your chair. Rotate your head slightly to the right and gently lower your nose towards your right knee. Nose to opposite knee stretch can be gently maintained for 30-45 seconds, slowly released and repeated a couple of times in a row if desired. Nose to opposite knee can be performed on both sides of the neck.

Upper back/shoulder exercise 7 - Forward reach

To stretch the muscles in your middle back between your shoulder blades, link your fingers together, roll your shoulders forwards and reach out in front of your body. Gently lower your chin to your chest to combine some additional neck stretch exercise.

Chest stretch exercise 8 - Backward reach

To stretch your chest and assist good posture, link your fingers together behind your back. Raise your arms away from your back and lift your chest at the same time. You should feel a gentle stretch across the front of your chest.

Reset your posture to finish

To complete your neck exercises, roll your shoulders in circles a couple of times, coordinate this action with your breathing and reset your posture with your spine straight and your shoulders relaxed and down.","['neck exercises', 'neck stretches', 'Physical Exercise (Word)', 'physical therapist', 'neck stretching exercises', 'neck exercise video', 'exercise video', 'Stretch', 'Stretching (Character Power)', 'Physical Therapy (Medical Specialty)', 'Neck Pain (Symptom)']",1.0992908179077265

5 Minute Guided Meditation for Gratitude / Mindful Movement,OCorElLKFQE,Meditation,5.95,681273,10241,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCorElLKFQE,"Take 5 minutes out of your busy day to practice the meditation for gratitude.  It is a great guided meditation for first thing in the morning or last thing before you drift off to sleep.

Can you sense the peaceful energy of life flowing through you, invigorating you with each breath? You are the embodiment of this lively energy. Your body is a miracle and a gift, the vehicle through which you have the privilege of experiencing this beautiful world. 

I challenge you to continue cultivating gratitude throughout your day. Perhaps you can even find something positive out of an experience that seems negative at first glance. 

We hope you enjoy!

--- Guided Meditation Script
Bring yourself into a comfortable seated or lying position, and when you feel settled,  gently close your eyes... Start with a few deep relaxing breaths... Breathing in through your nose... and out thru your mouth... Deep cleansing breaths... Feeling your belly expand fully on each in-breath... And feeling all the air leaving your body on the out-breath... (10 second pause) And on your next exhale, returning to your normal breathing rhythm... In and out thru your nose... Just watching the flow of your breath... Without trying to alter or change it in any way...  Just noticing it for its full cycle it as it moves through your body....Become aware of the change in temperature at the tip of your nose...  
Perhaps noticing that the air is slightly cooler on the inhalation than it is on the exhalation...Feel your chest and belly as they gently rise with each in-breath....And on each exhale, feeling your body soften as it releases any tension you’ve been holding onto...Imagining that with each in breath, your body is filling with vitalizing white light... And on each out-breath, that it’s melting into the comfort and support of your position........Your whole body, fully melted into relaxation....  Completely supported...  completely at ease........Now begin to imagine that with each inhalation your body is becoming lighter....Feeling your body gently filling with air, and becoming lighter and lighter with each in-breath...Having your body feeling so light, it‘s almost as if you are floating just up off of the ground....Completely at ease...  completely relaxed... completely rested....Now, take your awareness to the space in front of your closed eyes....  and just watch this space as you continue to breathe....What is it you can see here?...Perhaps you can only see darkness?...  Or maybe you can see colours... or patterns?...  Or images.... Maybe you can even see some movement...Just observe this space with your mind’s eye..... 
and allow your imagination to take over..... (5 second pause) Bringing your awareness back to the rhythmic flow of your breath... And preparing to count the breath. 1’ ..... Feeling fully rested 2’ .....Feeling restored and alert. And 3’ ...... Feeling Revitalized and ready to take on the rest of your day.

❖ Meditation and Mental Health
Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. In the demanding and fast-paced lives that will lead today, mental health is affecting more and more of us every day. While there are many forms of meditation, the ultimate goal is a feeling of relaxation and inner peace, which can help to improve mental health. And there's a growing body of research to support that.

❖ What is Short Meditation?
Throughout our days, we are usually rushed off our feet. Our brains are constantly working. We have little time to think clearly. Even when we go to sleep, a million thoughts run through our minds.
Short Meditation is a technique that a person will practice (usually daily) to clear their mind and to become present in the moment; which, in return will allow them to become more focused and awake. 
There many different ways to meditate to achieve a state of zen.

Check out our Short Meditation Playlist:

❖ Meditation and Mental Health
Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. In the demanding and fast-paced lives that will lead today, mental health is affecting more and more of us every day. While there are many forms of meditation, the ultimate goal is a feeling of relaxation and inner peace, which can help to improve mental health. And there's a growing body of research to support that.

❖ What is Short Meditation?
Throughout our days, we are usually rushed off our feet. Our brains are constantly working. We have little time to think clearly. Even when we go to sleep, a million thoughts run through our minds.
Short Meditation is a technique that a person will practice (usually daily) to clear their mind and to become present in the moment; which, in return will allow them to become more focused and awake. 
There many different ways to meditate to achieve a state of zen.

This 5 minute guided meditation for inner peace and calm will give you a break from the chaos in your mind by teaching your brain how to relax so you can feel *more* inner peace and calm *more* of the time.

Here's a quick tip, this meditation is not about clearing out the thoughts. It's your mind's function to think, so I promise you, you're not ""bad"" at meditation. It's also really important that your body is comfortable -- otherwise, your mind simply won't relax. So here's permission to lie down on your back, or your side, or sit in a chair or on the floor. 

After you practice this 5 minute guided meditation for inner peace and calm, I'd love to hear about your experience. Share with me in the comments!

We also become very in tune with ourselves and with the world here and beyond (sixth sense). I understand that many of us are on the 'GO' and rushing and may not find 20 or 30 minutes to meditate. How about 5 minutes? That is all it takes to invite more peace and calm into your life and get on with your day, that is all it takes to initiate the change the wellbeing of our bodies and to improve the reality around us.
You are worth all 60 minutes and more but if you do not have that time today 5 minutes is better than 0 😊 Find a quiet space, where you will not be disturbed just for 5 minutes and let your Inner Peace grow 🙌

Here are the affirmations used:
I am calm and centered
I am in love with life
I easily handle whatever comes my way
I have all the answers within me
I am a money magnet
I love every cell of my body
I am at peace with life
I am filled with creative energy
I appreciate those closest to me
All is well and I am safe
I am a magnet for miracles
I am productive and prosperous
I allow myself to play and be silly
My creative potential is endless
I am grateful for all that I receive
My healing is already in process
I allow abundance into my life
Joy is my birthright
I deserve to be loved and respected
I am unique and it is my greatest strength

Take 5 minutes out of your busy day to practice the meditation for gratitude.  It is a great guided meditation for first thing in the morning or last thing before you drift off to sleep.

Can you sense the peaceful energy of life flowing through you, invigorating you with each breath? You are the embodiment of this lively energy. Your body is a miracle and a gift, the vehicle through which you have the privilege of experiencing this beautiful world. 

I challenge you to continue cultivating gratitude throughout your day. Perhaps you can even find something positive out of an experience that seems negative at first glance. 

We hope you enjoy!

5 Reasons To Meditate

Understand your pain: Mental pain and anxiety are a background noise that can underlie much of what we do. Here’s a chance to see firsthand what’s causing it.

Lower stress: There’s lots of evidence these days that excess stress causes lots of illnesses and makes other illnesses worse. Mindfulness decreases stress.

Connect better: Ever find yourself staring blankly at a friend, lover, child, and you’ve no idea what they’re saying? Mindfulness helps you give them your full attention.

Improve focus: It can be frustrating to have our mind stray off what we’re doing and be pulled in six directions. Meditation hones our innate ability to focus.

Reduce brain chatter: The nattering, chattering voice in our head seems never to leave us alone. Isn’t it time we gave it a little break?

5 Reasons To Meditate

Understand your pain: Mental pain and anxiety are a background noise that can underlie much of what we do. Here’s a chance to see firsthand what’s causing it.

Lower stress: There’s lots of evidence these days that excess stress causes lots of illnesses and makes other illnesses worse. Mindfulness decreases stress.

Connect better: Ever find yourself staring blankly at a friend, lover, child, and you’ve no idea what they’re saying? Mindfulness helps you give them your full attention.

Improve focus: It can be frustrating to have our mind stray off what we’re doing and be pulled in six directions. Meditation hones our innate ability to focus.

Reduce brain chatter: The nattering, chattering voice in our head seems never to leave us alone. Isn’t it time we gave it a little break?

❖ Meditation and Mental Health
Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. In the demanding and fast-paced lives that will lead today, mental health is affecting more and more of us every day. While there are many forms of meditation, the ultimate goal is a feeling of relaxation and inner peace, which can help to improve mental health. And there's a growing body of research to support that.

❖ What is Short Meditation?
Throughout our days, we are usually rushed off our feet. Our brains are constantly working. We have little time to think clearly. Even when we go to sleep, a million thoughts run through our minds.
Short Meditation is a technique that a person will practice (usually daily) to clear their mind and to become present in the moment; which, in return will allow them to become more focused and awake. 
There many different ways to meditate to achieve a state of zen.

Here is a simple mindfulness meditation that you can easily do at home, or at work. We are so busy nowadays and it is good to just stop for a few minutes to get centered and calm. Sometimes we think that we can't relax because we have too much to do. In fact we HAVE to relax BECAUSE we have so much to do!

Just listen to the simple instructions, then you'll hear a bell tone and 5 minutes of music. Just close your eyes, breathe naturally, and keep your attention on your body. The meditation will finish with the bell tone again.
Enjoy and let me know what you think!

But in reality—especially when your phone is your alarm—it’s what’s there, pulling you out of peaceful slumber and racing toward the realities of your day.

To capture—or recapture—the stillness of that first moment of wakefulness, Austin-based yoga and meditation instructor Kate Waitzkin recorded a ten-minute guided meditation focused on clarity, stability, and presence for us. We like to listen to this morning meditation while we’re still in bed. But you can play it anytime you’re looking to center yourself in the present and find some clarity and stability.

This guided meditation will take you on a journey of relaxation by simply inviting you to focus on your breath.  As you first close your eyes, let this be a signal to your body to relax, then follow the sound of my voice to guide you deeper into a relaxed state.  Let my voice go with you throughout your day to help you relax and let go.  

Your breath is a wonderful focal point because it is always with you and you can tap into it any time you need, whether during meditation or in your activities of daily life.  This practice will strengthen your ability to be present outside of meditation.  You will clear the clutter of your mind to calm you.   It will reduce your stress level,  as well as improve your overall health and well being when practiced regularly.  

**For a powerful experience to help calm the overactive, overthinking mind, this meditation can be paired with this sleep practice to help you calm your mind before bed:  https://youtu.be/jcprGTfC4vc

Urgency
We often feel the need to rush and complete tasks to move onto the next one. To make decisions by a certain time. This feeling of urgency, a pressure that causes us to act without considering our natural process of movement is a form of anxiety. Urgency can lead to panic attacks as well as anxiety attacks. In this free 10 minute guided meditation we employ guided positive energy and vibrations by calmly the urgency and anxiety as well as address the rumination of overthinking (i.e., over analyzing) OCD (Obsessive compulsive Disorder).

Anxiety and Anxiety Attacks
There are many remedies for physical trauma but few for the emotional trauma's that we experience. Some of the root of Anxiety can be traced to physical medical condition, although I practice that all anxiety is physical, even if the root stems from an emotional experience. Anxiety has a foot print can be tracked. In this 10 minute guided meditation we use positive healing energy through meditation to follow a peaceful path away from anxiety, panic attacks, urgency, compulsive disorder, worry and fear to arrive at our peace within.

Using Guided Meditations for Anxiety:
Meditation has been scientifically proven beneficial for those who experience and even suffer from Anxiety. Meditation for anxiety, like out Positive Meditations, can transform the listeners experience and cause the mind to abandon anxiety impulses for a more peaceful and calming experience.

This guided meditation is all about allowing you to find time for yourself. Time to breathe, to be still, and simply be. Shot on a beautiful mountain, overlooking the Snow Canyon in Utah, this is your moment to allow yourself to truly look deeper within. A meditation for beginners and all levels and spiritual paths that will help you not only release tension and stress but it will also allow you to begin to deepen your practice in mindfulness and to train your mind for calm detachment from any unwanted patterns of over-thinking.  


By practicing these mindful techniques of conscious observation and self acceptance, you will find you are more able to quiet the mind and truly give yourself permission to dedicate time in your day for your mind and soul. 

Put on some headphones, close your eyes, and enjoy this 15 minute guided meditation.  

love & light,

Juliana and Mark

Know that you have all that you need within to be your own healer and the practice of meditation is a powerful tool for healing.  

All too often we look outside of ourselves for the answers to life's challenges.  When it comes to healing the body, we are quick to forget that our bodies already have their own innate ability to heal.  We cannot outsmart our body's inner wisdom.  Though doctors and alternative healers have a place in your journey, they only help us set up the environment to heal.  It is up to us to do the work.   

For today's practice, let's tip the scale in our favor.  Let's find a balance so our cells can relax and do what they have always known how to do.   

We hope you enjoy!

This simple guided meditation will help you keep calm and stay focused on your most important work.  

Sometimes having so many choices can lead to analysis paralysis.  So cut the distractions and listen to your intuition’s quiet knowledge.  You might think taking a short break for a meditation is counterproductive, but not true, taking a break from a task can make you more productive.  

This is a short guided meditation for focus and concentration.  So useful when studying, but also helpful for anytime when you need a little more clarity about your next task.  It will help you work at your optimum by clearing out unwanted distractions.  You know, things like negative thoughts, other people's opinions and your own unhelpful judgements.  

Keep calm and stay focused ....good luck!

❤ Clare

After that, via subscription, Headspace offers hundreds of hours of guided meditations on subjects ranging from stress to sleep to focus and more. Themed meditation courses are supported by a host of animations.

Along with daily meditations, Headspace also offers on-the-go exercises for users short on time, and SOS sessions to support subscribers in those meltdown moments.","['Headspace', 'meditation', 'mindfulness', 'Andy puddicombe', 'meditation app', 'how to meditate', 'meditation for beginners', 'mindfulness meditation', 'anxiety relief', 'stress relief', 'guided meditation', 'meditating', 'daily meditation', 'free guided meditation', 'how to meditate for beginners', 'meditation mindfulness', 'meditation guided', 'happiness', 'positive', 'inspiration', 'motivation', 'relax', 'relaxing', 'mini meditation', '10 minute meditation', 'free meditation', 'meditate with andy', 'meditate at home', 'relax at home']",1.5509873096801554

It is a great guided meditation for first thing in the morning or last thing before you drift off to sleep.

Can you sense the peaceful energy of life flowing through you, invigorating you with each breath? You are the embodiment of this lively energy. Your body is a miracle and a gift, the vehicle through which you have the privilege of experiencing this beautiful world. 

I challenge you to continue cultivating gratitude throughout your day. Perhaps you can even find something positive out of an experience that seems negative at first glance. 

We hope you enjoy!

But in reality—especially when your phone is your alarm—it’s what’s there, pulling you out of peaceful slumber and racing toward the realities of your day.

To capture—or recapture—the stillness of that first moment of wakefulness, Austin-based yoga and meditation instructor Kate Waitzkin recorded a ten-minute guided meditation focused on clarity, stability, and presence for us. We like to listen to this morning meditation while we’re still in bed. But you can play it anytime you’re looking to center yourself in the present and find some clarity and stability.

The bestselling author of The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck and Get Your Sh*t Together, Sarah Knight, outlines her ""NotSorry Method"" to stop spending time you don't have doing things you don't want to do in her
humorous talk.

After fifteen years working in New York City's top publishing houses,Sarah Knight struck out on her own. Since then, her essay ""I Quit My JobToday (And So Can You!)""- went viral, and her book, ""The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck: How to Stop Spending Time You Don't Have with People You Don't Like Doing Things You Don't Want to Do"", became a bestseller. The escape from corporate life and transformation into an ""accidental anti-guru"" continued when she and her husband moved to Las Terrenas, Dominican Republic. Sarah's new book explains how to ""Get Your Shit Together: How to Stop Worrying About What You Should Do So You Can Finish What You Need to Do and Start Doing What You Want to Do."" Sarah graduated cum laude with a degree in English and American Literature from
Harvard University.

Recorded at TEDxVancouver at Rogers Arena on November 14, 2015.

Our knowledge of the brain is evolving at a breathtaking pace, and Dr. Lara Boyd is positioned at the cutting edge of these discoveries. In 2006, she was recruited by the University of British Columbia to become the Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology and Motor Learning. Since that time she has established the Brain Behaviour Lab, recruited and trained over 40 graduate students, published more than 80 papers and been awarded over $5 million in funding. 

Dr. Boyd’s efforts are leading to the development of novel, and more effective, therapeutics for individuals with brain damage, but they are also shedding light on broader applications. By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless possibility.

""If we want to fix our politics, we have to do something about inequality,"" says social psychologist Keith Payne. Showing how economic inequality changes the way people see and behave towards one another, Payne helps explain the rise of the political polarization that's slicing up society -- and challenges us to think twice the next time we dismiss someone for the sake of politics.

Tim Urban knows that procrastination doesn't make sense, but he's never been able to shake his habit of waiting until the last minute to get things done. In this hilarious and insightful talk, Urban takes us on a journey through YouTube binges, Wikipedia rabbit holes and bouts of staring out the window -- and encourages us to think harder about what we're really procrastinating on, before we run out of time.

Quit social media | Dr. Cal Newport | TEDxTysons,3E7hkPZ-HTk,Educational,13.85,7169378,149745,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk,"'Deep work' will make you better at what you do. You will achieve more in less time. And feel the sense of true fulfillment that comes from the mastery of a skill.

Cal Newport is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University. In addition to studying the theoretical foundations of our digital age, Newport also writes about the impact of these technologies on the world of work.  His most recent book, Deep Work, argues that focus is the new I.Q. in the modern workplace and that the ability to concentrate without distraction is becoming increasingly valuable. He previously wrote So Good They Can’t Ignore You, a book which debunks the long-held belief that “follow your passion” is good advice, and three popular books of unconventional advice for students.

In hindsight, we know what we should have done better. So, now's the time, Bill Gates suggests, to put all our good ideas into practice, from scenario planning to vaccine research to health worker training. As he says, ""There's no need to panic ... but we need to get going.""

You're not at your best when you're stressed. In fact, your brain has evolved over millennia to release cortisol in stressful situations, inhibiting rational, logical thinking but potentially helping you survive, say, being attacked by a lion. Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin thinks there's a way to avoid making critical mistakes in stressful situations, when your thinking becomes clouded — the pre-mortem. ""We all are going to fail now and then,"" he says. ""The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be.""

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","['sports', 'Ryerson', 'recruitment', 'athletics', 'self confidence', 'ted', 'football', 'English', 'soccer', 'tedx talk', 'student', 'ted talk', 'ted x', 'TEDxRyersonU', 'tedx', 'originality', 'confidence', 'Canada', 'Ryerson University', 'ted talks', 'skills', 'agility', 'tedx talks']",1.7096442506768104
How to make stress your friend | Kelly McGonigal,RcGyVTAoXEU,Educational,14.48,10638048,156810,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGyVTAoXEU,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized talk recommendations and more.

Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive, and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: reaching out to others.

The TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less). Look for talks on Technology, Entertainment and Design -- plus science, business, global issues, the arts and more. You're welcome to link to or embed these videos, forward them to others and share these ideas with people you know.

CGI Sci-Fi Short Film: &quot;The Pantheon&quot; by Han Yang | CGMeetup,ZPc2UIgryJU,Short Movie,5.0,294502,7623,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPc2UIgryJU,"CGI Sci-Fi Short Film: The Pantheon SciFi Short Film Directed by Han Yang. Featured on CGMeetup https://www.cgmeetup.com/ Also Check Lander Short film https://youtu.be/_jYShB3iQi4

During the age of the Black Magic, stories were told that a space crystal is the key to unlock a
portal between two worlds. Whoever acquires the key can unlock the portal at a lost temple
called The Pantheon. The story begins with the battle between the Archer and the Orc.

This film has been in production for almost a year. After releasing the last short The Lander,
feedback from the creative community was overwhelmingly positive. With the experience of
producing The Lander, Pantheon is a new exploration in different genres and overall upgrade to the workflow and visual fidelity. Being able to utilize motion capture really brought the characters to life and allowed the design of complex action fighting sequences. Music and sound design also helped to immerse the audience into the film’s magic world.
In terms of the production and workflow, most of the work was done by Han Yang including
animation, shading, lighting and rendering. Music was composed by Andrea Bellucci, with years of experience with Hollywood style music scoring, his sound track brought the epicness into the film. Sound effects was a collaboration between a team of four artists, Francois Huber, Maria Camarena, Chengshuo Hou and Ziting Zhao. They designed all the foley and sound FX including sword fight, energy burst and character dialogue. Unreal Engine was still the main part of the pipeline, where 90% of the shots were rendered from. Real-time rendering technology is getting better and better each day, the gap between offline photoreal render and real-time engine rendering is shrinking.

Software: Maya for animation, layout and CFX. 
90% of the film was fully rendered in Unreal Engine.
Vray was used for close-ups and composited with Unreal rendered background.
Xsens and iPhone for body, face motion capture.
Nuke for compositing.

Artist Profile: Han Yang is a CG Supervisor working in the VFX industry at Method Studio. He has worked in many high profile Hollywood feature films including Logan, Aquaman, and recently Detective Pikachu. Having worked in the industry for many years, he has expanded his involvement in the production from animation to producing his own short CG film. The Pantheon is his latest short CG film. Rendered in photo-realistic cinematic quality utilizing real-time rendering technology, along with dynamic camera movement and intense action sequence design, his films seek to deliver the maximum visual impact to the audience.

TOKRI
Directed by Suresh Eriyat
http://studioeeksaurus.com/

The spark for today's short film came from an everyday experience, simple and mundane. Traversing the crowded streets of Mumbai in his car, animator Suresh Eriyat was approached by a young girl selling baskets. Eriyat shooed her away—it is assumed by most that the hordes of children who pounce upon motorists at the stoplights of the city are organized by gangs, thus any charity exhibited directly rewards the practice of putting children to work as beggars. Yet, despite the unremarkable nature of this occurrence, Eriyat was struck by guilt. Describing the thoughts that circled his mind, he writes, ""What if she was in a precarious situation where she had to sell baskets to bring peace to her home? What if she needed some help from Me? How insensitive of me?"" The premise of a story was born, one that would take 8 years to bring to completion. 

That Tokri should take 8 years to create is in some sense a surprise. One of India's foremost independent animators, Eriyat is astonishingly prolific, with over 450 completed works in a multitude of styles: stop-motion, 3D, and 2D hand-drawn, among other techniques. Much of this output is commercial work, for which he's been duly recognized—honors from the Clios and Cannes Lions are on his resumé, as well as the status of being India's first winner of an Annecy Cristal, but now a decade out from the creation of his own studio alongside his wife, Nilima, Eriyat's ambition has grown to ever more elaborate personal projects, of which Tokri is the crowning achievement to date. 

While a relatively simple story, grounded in the lived experience of India's destitute, Tokri overflows with detail. The scale of the production is truly remarkable—we adore stop-motion, with over 100 films in our collection, but despite the overwhelming diversity of subjects and styles you'll encounter while traversing the catalog there are a few commonalities to the majority of them: tight compositions, confined spaces, relatively few characters. These decisions are often right for the story, but they are also a compromise to the pain-staking nature of the craft, an attempt to reduce complexity within scenes. An unusual degree of motion abounds within even simple scenes in Tokri, and Eriyat and his team are unafraid of going wide as well, in shots that seek to depict the cacophony of the Mumbai streetscape and which encompass dozens of moving elements. We always love a good stop-motion timelapse, and the video below gives you a good sense of the undertaking.

LA NORIA
Directed by Carlos Baena
A NightWheel Pictures Film
https://www.lanoriafilm.com/

""The minute you press play and the initial images of La Noria wash over your eyeballs, one’s immediate reaction is a simple “wow”. Maybe you’re more jaded than me, and the sheer insanity of modern CG animation fails to move you, but speaking for myself, despite 10,000 hours of short film watching under my belt, a life-long love of animation, and the existence of recent photo-real short films like Garden Party, the level of design polish in great, commercially-minded 3D animations can still take my breath away. Fortunately La Noria has a couple of minutes of setup in the beginning, because shortly thereafter my breath taken away again for altogether different reasons. 

The annals of CG horror shorts in this sort of mainstream style is rather limited—""9"", by Shane Acker, certainly played in this space, and ""Alma"" is a creepy holiday classic. Both films are over a decade old though, and neither can really match ""La Noria"" for sheer terror. From the monster design which feels ripped out of some the most twisted corners of the Resident Evil game franchise, to the tense horror-chase mechanics, this film is, in spite of its seemingly kid-friendly design, truly adrenaline-producing. 

The story itself is a touch less impressive, but ultimately satisfying. It has elements of heart-string pulling, as it focuses on a ferris wheel-loving child who is torn up over the loss of his father. Gathering photos and other mementos together into a sort of shrine, the child’s heart-ache seems to birth the darkness that soon threatens him. Details from the photos hint at a back-story—the military uniform his father wears for example—and naturally create associations in one’s mind to the work of Guillermo Del Toro and his masterpiece ""Pan’s Labyrinth"". While this setup is nicely pulled together into a cathartic and feel-good ending, it is mainly table-setting for the action, which is intense, and in comprising the bulk of the 11min runtime, quite long by short animation standards. 

One can’t question the exquisiteness of this action—a spooky old mansion, replete with string lights and stained glass windows, provides a splendid backdrop for scrambling chases and doors frantically being shut in the face of grasping monsters. More so than even the design quality, it is in these sequences that the experience and skill of director Carlos Baena seems to show. 

Baena has over 20 years of experience in animation with tenures at Industrial Light & Magic, and Pixar on his resume, with credits that include work on massive franchises such Star Wars, Toy Story, and Jurassic Park. Produced under the banner of his own production company, NightWheel Pictures, Baena took advantage of his status as co-founder of Artella, an animation platform that allows for virtual collaboration, in the creation of the film. Baena used the platform to source a diverse crew of independent artists to work on La Noria, with over 100 contributors ultimately joining the project, hailing from all over the world. 

The result paid off—not only is ""La Noria"" a stunning showpiece for Baena and Artella, it has received widespread acclaim, winning dozens of awards, including Best Short at Tokyo’s prestigious Short Shorts Asia. Dropping online this week with an exclusive post on Variety, the celebration from worldwide audiences is sure to spread. As for Baena’s next steps, he is currently set up at Paramount Pictures. Details on his projects there are under wraps for now, but with luck, we’ll be seeing a feature film from Baena on the big screen in the near future."" - S/W Curator, Jason Sondhi

La Luna (The Moon) is a short animation of Pixar Animation Studios in cooperation with Walt Disney Pictures. The 7-minute film was made by Italian director Enrico Casarosa, who also wrote the screenplay. The producer is Kevin Reher and the screenplay is handled by Enrico Casarosa.
Director: Enrico Casarosa
Writer: Enrico Casarosa
Stars: Tony Fucile, Krista Sheffler, Phil Sheridan
The source: https://www.pixar.com/la-luna

The content of La Luna is very cute, telling a boy named Bambino on the first day of inheriting the family's traditional work. He was dragged by his father and grandfather into an old wooden boat - the small boat was named ""La Luna"". His mission is to help his father and grandfather harvest the stars and clean them up on the moon. However, there was a small dispute between the father and grandfather. Will the boy choose to work in one of two relatives or in another direction that Bambino thinks is right?

""What is a Model Citizen? A Model Citizen is a providing father. A Model Citizen is a caring mother, all in service of a scrappy, young boy or girl. A Model Child raised by a Model Family, to become a Model Citizen of their own!""
This brand-spanking-new installment of the Autodale series follows the lives of the Robinson family; Autodale's perfect citizens.

I've wanted to make an animated short film based around the life-cycle of an Autodale citizen/family for a very long time. We've only ever seen Autodale through the eyes of children. All of the other short films in the series focus on skeptical children being successfully brainwashed/indoctrinated into complacency with Autodale's dystopian ways. This short film doesn't have that arc. This short film is about the parents. These characters have NO DOUBTS about how this system works anymore...

SONG:
Tchaikovsky - ""Waltz of the Flowers

GUEST VOICE ACTOR:
Mrs. Robinson - ""Kirie Quackenbush""
